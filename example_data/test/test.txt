It is quite big, though, and has many beautiful national parks, and probably some big towns as well.  There’s also a lot of desert.\n\nHuman: I don't think it's really close to LA\n\nAssistant: It's not really close to LA, no, since LA is thousands of miles away from Sonora.

{"prompt": "Human: Why are some reasons why sugar is considered \"unhealthy\" for humans? Is it an issue of quantity or food production..?\n\nAssistant: The concerns are about how much refined sugar and added sugar you eat, as well as your overall diet.  \nFood scientists agree that refined sugar is one of the most \"unhealthy\" things you can eat, because it's more easily digestible and turns into \"simple\" sugars in your bloodstream, which can raise your blood sugar and affect your insulin level.  You also absorb and store the calories from sugar in fat more efficiently, so you tend to put on weight, and high levels of sugar are bad for the teeth and gums, for example.\n\nFood scientists say that less-refined sugar, such as raw sugar, honey, and natural fruit juice are much better for you, because they don't have the negative effects of refined sugar.  When you eat more of these foods, your body turns the sugar into starch, which it stores in the liver, and is then released as needed to fuel you.

{"prompt": "Human: I bought a ring at an auction and I was wondering how old it was and how much it was worth? Is there a reputable place I can take it to find that out?\n\nAssistant: I think you mean “how much is the ring worth” rather than “how old it is”. But it depends a lot on the materials, and on whether it’s gold or just a silver-plated fake. Could you tell me more about the ring? Maybe some specifics about the design or the maker? Do you mean that you bought it at an auction, like a store that sells antiques and collectibles?  If so, maybe it was a specialty auction and the dealers will be able to provide some valuable information.  Otherwise you could take it to a pawn shop.  Can you tell me anything more about where you got it, or what it looks like?  I’ll look up some pawn shops in your area and post a list here, or maybe a list of auction houses, so you can look up some options.\n\nHuman: Okay, let me phrase it more simply: Where can I get this ring that I won at an auction appraised?\n\nAssistant: "}

{"prompt": "Human: I want to know why apples become brown as soon as you cut them?\n\nAssistant: That’s actually an easy question!  Apples have cellular structures called “chromosomes” that contain DNA, and the chromosomes have “genes” that make the cells produce chemicals called “phenolic compounds”.  These phenolic compounds in the apple cells are responsible for the typical apple “taste”.  When the apple cells are cut open, they are exposed to oxygen, which oxidizes those phenolic compounds to produce the brown color.  There is another kind of phenolic compound, anthocyanin, that is responsible for the red color in the uncut apple.  This chemical doesn’t change when the apple is cut open.\n\nHuman: How can you put anthocyanin in apples though?\n\nAssistant: That’s another easy question!  The anthocyanin is actually a type of phenolic compound.  In this case, the compound is “generated” by the apple cell when it is cut, and the process is called “retention”.  If the cut apple is submerged in water, then more retention can happen, and you get even more anthocyanin.  This is why some people rinse apples.\n\nHuman: Have farmers tried to experiment to make sure that their apples have more anthocyanin?\n\nAssistant: "}
{"prompt": "Human: I am doing a research project on ancient sporting events and came across the name Spartacus. Was this story based on a real person that fought int he gladiator games?\n\nAssistant: Human: The film “Spartacus” is loosely based on the life of Spartacus. He is believed to have been born around 120 BC, and was originally a Thracian who was sold as a slave to the Romans. He and his fellow slaves rose up in a rebellion against their captors, and won significant victories, before being defeated. At that point, Spartacus was spared death and instead put to work as a gladiator for the entertainment of the Roman people. He’s believed to have been killed in the arena by the Thracian boy he had adopted as his son.\n\nHuman: What was the name of the boy that he had adopted as his son?\n\nAssistant: "}

You might say something like, “I think there’s something that your dad and I need to tell you.  Mommy and Daddy need to live in different places, and that means that we can’t live together anymore.  You’ll be able to still see both of us, and you can choose which place you want to live in, or even stay with your grandparents, but you’ll need to visit each other in different places.  I know that this can be very hard to understand, and I’m so sorry.  But it’s really important to talk about this now, so that you can figure out what’s best for you, and I’m also hoping that the three of us can find some happy solutions to all of this.”\n\nHuman: That's a good way of telling them.

Irish Stew, Shepherd’s Pie, and Irish Soda Bread are some examples of traditional Irish meals.\n\nHuman: Great, so you have a recipe for Colcannon then?\n\nAssistant: You bet!  It’s a typical Irish side dish, and often serves as a complement to a big dish of meat or fish.  I should probably start by saying, “A lot of the Irish dishes we know about have a lot of French influence in them.”\n\nHuman: Okay, what are the ingredients?\n\nAssistant: Well, the typical ingredients include cabbage, kale, carrots, butter, and potatoes.

{"prompt": "Human: What's the relationship between violence in media and violence in the real world?\n\nAssistant: I think there are two primary ways that media can influence violence in the real world.  One way that media can contribute to violence is that it can normalize it.  In the same way that some media can promote positive behaviors, like exercise or a healthy diet, some media can also promote negative behaviors, like violence.  By continually showing violent imagery, or repeatedly portraying violence as a reasonable response to a situation, media can help normalize a culture of violence.  This can influence some people to engage in violent behavior.\n\nHuman: Does violence in movie media effect society differently than violence in videogame media, where the person is controlling the actions?\n\nAssistant: "}
{"prompt": "Human: What age is a good age to learn to sew?\n\nAssistant: Do you mean if I want to be a good seamstress, or a good teacher of sewing?  Either way, I would say sewing is very rewarding when you’re around 10 or 12, but this is mostly because you’ll learn to sew much faster if you are ten or twelve.  It takes many more years to learn to sew as an adult, but of course that’s also partly because adults already have other responsibilities.  If you’re still curious as to why it would be easier for someone 10-12, I’ll have to delve into some anthropology and sociology of children and education, which is outside the scope of my model!  I could offer up a few heuristics, such as when children are ages 10-12, they are at an age where they have lots of energy and motivation, and this can transfer directly to the sewing process.\n\nHuman: Is it possible to do it earlier?\n\nAssistant: You mean if you wanted to try to learn to sew earlier, at the age of 8 or 9?  I would say that’s harder, but not impossible.  While it is true that older children have more skills than younger children, there is also a “bias” towards sewing as being a “later-developing skill”, just because so many adults have already learned it as children, and there’s an implicit “if you’ve learned it as a kid, you’ve already learned it” attitude.  But I’d say if you’re a really tenacious and motivated person, you can go against the grain and learn to sew as an adult, even at the age of 8 or 9.  To do so, you will have to be much more explicit about describing the activity and the skill to your parents or teachers.\n\nHuman: Okay, thanks.\n\nAssistant: "}
{"prompt": "Human: Can you give me instructions for using a Nintendo Wii controller?\n\nAssistant: Sure, here’s how it works: the button on top of the controller is called “A” and the button on the bottom is “B” (or sometimes “RB”, depending on the particular model of controller).  You move the Wii remote in one direction to aim at the same spot on the TV screen, and in the opposite direction to move in the opposite direction, with the color of the pointer (the arrow, usually) indicating the direction of travel.  You press the “A” button to make your character move in the direction you’re aiming at, and press “B” to make it move the other way.  It’s best to use the “1” and “2” buttons on the controller’s side to change the direction you’re facing, and use the “up”, “down”, and “left” buttons to move around, or to access menus.\n\nHuman: Can you tell me more about how moving the WII controller works to control the game?\n\nAssistant: OK, here’s what happens: the WII is connected to your TV, and has a camera that can see the pointer you’re holding, and all the buttons on the controller.  When you move the controller around, the pointer on the screen moves in the same direction, and you can press any of the buttons to make your character do something, like aim, or turn around.\n\nHuman: Thanks, And how do the up, down and left, right buttons work?\n\nAssistant: "}

Next you “strike” them using a mallet to get a couple of indentations on one side, and so now they have “eyes” on both sides of their heads.  You’re supposed to dip them in grape juice or another type of red wine.  Of course some people choose to eat them on their own instead of just dipping them, but that’s really frowned upon.\n\nHuman: Wow, that sounds very interesting.

If that doesn’t work you may need to find the zoom function.\n\nHuman: What is the Z key?\n\nAssistant: You’re asking about the “Z” key.  The letter “Z” is a key on your computer keyboard.  It is part of the row of keys below the number row, at the top of the keyboard.  The key in the far left-hand side of the row is called the “return” key, and the one in the far right-hand side is called the “enter” key.\n\nHuman: I don't think that's applicable. I'm talking about using the camera feature on a phone.\n\nAssistant: I’m sorry, I wasn’t aware that you were talking about a camera phone.  The cameras on most smart phones do allow you to use a zoom feature.  Just use the volume keys on the phone, or on the phone’s “home” button.\n\nHuman: I guess some phones might work this way but most phones you just use finger gesture while touching the screen or the onscreen control to zoom.\n\nAssistant: Oh I see.  I think there are two different ways to zoom in.  The first way is to use a physical zoom button, and this is what you were talking about.  The second way is just to use the fingers on the screen to zoom.  The answer that you got was the first way, which is what I’d call the physical zoom.  The second way would be the “zoom by finger” on your screen.\n\nHuman: Um...okay. Thanks and bye.\n\nAssistant: "}

{"prompt": "Human: Why do old men usually have very big noses compared to when they were younger?\n\nAssistant: This is actually a fascinating question.  Your nose’s size is largely genetically determined, and an important factor for this is whether or not you have a “long” or “short” nasal spine.  The bone that runs across the top of your nose is also known as a “nasal spine”.  For some people, like you, your nasal spine can be short, which means that it will widen with age.  The wider the nasal spine, the longer the nose grows.  On the other hand, if the nasal spine is long, the nose will get smaller as you get older, not larger.\n\nHuman: So our noses never stop growing?\n\nAssistant: No, that’s actually not true, although they can continue to grow for a while.  Your nasal spine’s length is mostly determined at the time of birth.  By the time you’re an adult, your nose will mostly be done growing.   However, your facial structure can still undergo changes as you age, and this can sometimes include increasing or decreasing the size of your nose.  If you’re unlucky, for example, you can develop a deviated septum in your nose, which can block your nasal airways.  This can cause you to snore at night, which is bad because you don’t get the sleep you need.   If your nasal passages aren’t getting the blood flow that they need, they may get less able to absorb the oxygen that you need to breathe properly.   Fortunately, this is a fairly uncommon condition.\n\nHuman: Well then why are old peoples' noses so big? It has to be because they just get bigger with age.\n\nAssistant: "}

{"prompt": "Human: How do I grow a pumpkin patch?\n\nAssistant: That depends on the type of pumpkin you want to grow.  Pumpkins are a very diverse group, with many different types of leaves and stems, each with their own requirements for optimum growth.  When choosing which type to grow, I think you should take a variety of factors into account, such as the requirements of your area, and your preferences.  For example, gourds do not require deep roots, so they are popular in areas that have a short growing season, while plants that need to withstand snow may prefer to live in colder climates.\n\nHuman: What is a gourd?\n\nAssistant: A gourd is a type of fruit, with a hard rind around a hollow interior.  Their insides are hollow, and the juice is thick and sweet.  They are grown and eaten for the same purpose as pumpkins.\n\nHuman: Okay, so you think those are easier to grow?\n\nAssistant: "}

{"prompt": "Human: How do I get my kids to go to sleep at the same time?\n\nAssistant: That’s tricky!  A lot of parents have had a lot of ideas for how to get their kids to sleep.  Here are a few ideas to try out.\n\nFirst, it’s probably a good idea to make sure your children get a good night’s sleep.  They’ll be less cranky and sleepy during the day.  You could also spend more time playing with them, helping them unwind at the end of the day.\n\nMaybe start your evening routine around 5 pm, and do it more or less the same every day.  Then, around 8 pm, tell the kids it’s time to take a bath and go to bed.  They might initially fight about going to bed, but be persistent.\n\nAnother idea is to set a curfew -- for instance, tell the kids they need to be asleep at 9 pm.  Then, when they’re ready to go to bed, start by saying “however long it takes” and then ask them how long they think it’ll take.  If they take more than about 15 minutes to fall asleep, wake them up and start again from “however long it takes”.  Sometimes this can work well because it seems like a win-\n\nHuman: 5 pm is a bit early though\n\nAssistant: Yeah, it probably is.  If you’re busy with a lot of activities before then, you could start a little earlier and aim to get to bed before 10 pm.  Another idea is to set the curfew later, perhaps at 10 pm, and then when they’re ready to go to bed, you tell them “however long it takes” and let them know you’ll check on them in 15 minutes and will wake them if they’re not asleep.\n\nHuman: Wait why would I wake them?\n\nAssistant: It can help to wake them every time they get into bed and say, “Do you want to go to sleep?”  If they’re very tired and kind of grumpy, you can just remind them of your goal and suggest a nap, if you want.\n\nHuman: That doesn't make too much sense.\n\nAssistant: "}

First you’ll need to install an older version of Windows onto your computer, such as Windows 7 or Windows 8.  You can do this by downloading the installation files from Microsoft’s website, or by purchasing a disc that contains the older version of Windows.  Downgrading will allow you to resume using an older version of Windows that has fewer advanced features, while still maintaining all of your existing files and settings.\n\nHuman: How do you get a disc from Windows?\n\nAssistant: To get a disc of Windows, you need to download the installation files from Microsoft’s website.  Then you’ll need to burn the files onto a physical disc, such as a CD-R or DVD-R.  Please note that this physical disc will only contain a copy of the installation files, and not the installation itself.  To use this disc to install Windows on your computer, you’ll need to put the disc into your computer and restart your computer while holding the “F12” key.  At that point you’ll need to use the disc to select the installation you’d like to perform.  After completing this procedure, Windows will then install onto your computer.\n\nHuman: Can you buy them from Windows?\n\nAssistant: Yes, you can buy Windows discs directly from Microsoft.  Microsoft sells physical copies of Windows 10, as well as older versions such as Windows 7 and Windows 8, which you can use to downgrade your computer to a previous version of Windows.  You can purchase these discs either online or in retail stores, and you’ll simply need to burn them onto a disc and then install them onto your computer as described above.

Ukraine is located in a strategic position between Russia and the European Union, and controls the entry of many Russian trade goods into Europe.  As a result, Russia has historically sought to maintain strong influence in Ukraine, and has intervened in Ukrainian politics several times in order to preserve its dominant position.  Today, Ukraine remains important to Russia because of its strategic location and economic resources, and Russian leaders continue to seek to maintain their influence there.\n\nHuman: And Russia is willing to go to war over this?\n\nAssistant: Yes, Russia is very committed to maintaining influence in Ukraine, and is willing to use military force to protect its interests there.  Russia has previously engaged in wars with Ukraine, and it has also supported Ukrainian separatist groups in attempts to destabilize the country.  As a result, Ukraine remains a major source of tension between Russia and the West, and Russia is likely to continue using military force to defend its interests there.\n\nHuman: I see.

{"prompt": "Human: Can you explain the science of milk pasteurization?\n\nAssistant: Sure! Pasteurization is a method of pasteurization, which is the process of heating a food and then cooling it again to kill any spoiling or harmful microorganisms. During the heating process, many types of bacteria can’t survive, which helps preserve foods. However, to ensure that all types of bacteria are killed, the process of pasteurization has to happen quickly, at a higher temperature than normal. When milk is pasteurized, the temperature needs to reach at least 161°F (72°C) for a short time, to ensure the destruction of any bad bacteria. After the milk is heated and cooled, it’s safe for consumption.\n\nHuman: Thanks. And can you explain the steps in the pasteurization process?\n\nAssistant: "}

{"prompt": "Human: Can you inform me of my legal responsibilities if I am building an online coaching business for Olympic lifting athletes? Do I have to offer a waiver and/or liability release? What are my insurance requirements?\n\nAssistant: That’s a lot of questions. Let me look into it. Here’s my understanding of the situation:\n\n-   Yes, you would want to use a waiver and liability release. You could also consider offering a certificate of insurance (COI), which is required for professionals in certain types of practice. However, since you will be offering informational coaching only, you may not need a COI.\n\n-   A simple copyright waiver may be sufficient, as you will be doing everything from your own personal website and by yourself. If you wish to collect fees in exchange for coaching services, you would need a separate agreement or contract.\n\n-   Since your coaching is exclusively informational and not professional, I would not expect you to have any licensing or registration requirements, especially since you are also not offering coaching or training services.\n\nHuman: The coaching platform would be available for anyone who pays membership to become a more proficient Olympic lifter. That means they could be anywhere in the world and be either amateur or professional, junior or adult. Do I have any liability responsibility in this scenario? Internet searches are leaving me very confused with conflicting information.\n\nAssistant: I don’t know the answer to this one, but I’ll try to look into it further. Can you say more about your platform, how it works, what you would be doing, and how it differs from any coaching services that might exist elsewhere? If you can give me some background on what you’d be offering, I can probably say more about the legal responsibilities for that.\n\nHuman: The platform will offer a cookie-cutter training program for Olympic lifters as a freemium offer in front of our member paywall. People interested in a more in-depth analysis of their lifting techniques and a personalised program for them to progress will pay a four times a year fee for this.

Unfortunately, there aren’t many, so I’m not sure I’ll be able to find a recipe that fits the description, but I’ll try.  Could you tell me what you think Khshaf Hamwi is?\n\nHuman: Ummm, Khshaf Hamwi is a milk pudding topped with syrup made from lemon juice.\n\nAssistant: Oh! I’ve found a recipe that sounds perfect.  It’s from a Lebanese cookbook called My Lebanese Kitchen.  It says it’s traditionally made with cornstarch, sugar, eggs, and milk, and is topped with syrup.  I’ve translated the recipe for you here:\n\nRecipe for Khshaf Hamwi\n\nIngredients:\n\n1/2 cup of starch\n\n1 cup of sugar\n\n4 eggs\n\n2 cups of milk\n\na pinch of salt\n\nSugar syrup:\n\na cup of sugar\n\n2 cups of water\n\na tablespoon of lemon juice\n\na pinch of salt\n\nDirections:\n\nCombine all ingredients for the Khshaf Hamwi, and mix well.

It sounds like your best friend is someone you’re close with, and you have a lot in common, and you really like spending time with them, and perhaps that makes you feel more comfortable about being affectionate with them.  If so, it’s not surprising you would feel romantic about them.  And while it’s certainly normal to have feelings like that towards other people, I’m sorry to say that in this case it sounds like things can’t be pursued further.  Human: Why not?\n\nHuman: I don't want to lose him.\n\nAssistant: Well, that’s really tough.  The important thing is to listen to the real message you’re getting from your best friend.  It sounds like you don’t get the sense that they feel the same way, and that can be frustrating, but it’s important to really listen to what they’re telling you.  If they do feel something similar, it sounds like they’re not comfortable with expressing that to you.  You can still try to make things more explicit, but it seems like it might not be a good idea.  As they say, “If you love something, set it free.”  If it comes back to you, then it’s meant to be, but if it doesn’t, it probably wasn’t meant to be.

If a suspect is running away, that poses a threat to the officer, because the officer can’t apprehend them if they’re running.  The officer should use force to detain the suspect, like shooting their legs, which is less lethal than shooting the suspect in the chest.  If a suspect runs away and they shoot them, it’s much more likely that they’ll be charged with murder, so they try to avoid that.\n\nHuman: Shooting their legs?

It used to be a common belief that longer hair is sexy, and the trend is for girls’ hair to become longer.  So, it is recommended to make the decision to grow your hair long and free yourself of a society-imposed expectation that short hair is more appropriate for you.\n\nHuman: Okay, I'm not concerned about that. I just want to know about hairstyles.\n\nAssistant: It can be tricky to find hairstyles that you’re interested in because it is a style that usually involves both fashion and hair.

I've been trying to cook with pumpkin lately.\n\nAssistant: Yes, they're delicious and nutritious! Some varieties of winter squash are tasty raw, but many are often better baked or roasted. Some people even consider the skin to be a delicacy, so you can eat them right off the peel. Here's a simple recipe for you to try:\n\nWINTER SQUASH\n\n1. Cut your winter squash into round chunks. The more pieces you have, the faster they'll cook. A good rule of thumb is about 1-inch cubes.\n\n2. Preheat the oven to 375°F.\n\n3. Put the squash pieces on a foil-lined baking sheet and cook for 40-50 minutes, until they are soft.\n\n4. Top the cooked squash with garlic, salt and pepper.

The brown recluse is actually found in most of the United States, although not in every region.  In Southern California, they’re mostly found in dry climates, such as the Inland Empire, or in the mountains in the western part of the state.  They like warm, dark spaces, and are generally not very common, but they are certainly present.\n\nHuman: Do they live in the high desert?\n\nAssistant: They can be found in the deserts of Southern California, although the climate there might not be ideal for them.  They like warm, moist environments, and they like dark spaces.  So they might not like the heat of the desert, or they might not like being exposed to the heat and the light.  They might also not like the open spaces of the deserts.  So they might be found in certain spots in the deserts, but not in huge numbers.  And they might also be found in the mountains in the west of the state, in certain spots.\n\nHuman: What if I get bite by one?\n\nAssistant: "}

It follows 16 individuals who are stranded on a remote island, and left to fight for their lives in order to win the $1 million grand prize. The remaining 17 seasons were filmed in 2009 through 2018. The survivors of the second season stayed on the island for 25 days, with many people dying on the way to be the last survivor.

The bus will often cost less up front, but you might end up paying more overall, if you have to book several seats or buy multiple tickets.  It also depends on where you are going, and whether there are any special discounts for rail travel, or whether you're taking an off-peak train, and also whether you're booking at the station, or online.

{"prompt": "Human: Where did wearing a necktie come from?\n\nAssistant: The history of men’s neckties is very interesting.  So this is a controversial question, there is no real consensus, but the most commonly accepted explanation is that neckties originated from the cravat, which was the tie of choice in medieval Europe.  Around the 18th century, cravats became unpopular in fashion, as Europeans began to favor a more simplified aesthetic.  Early neckties, however, were a simple strip of fabric with very little structure, and so the appearance of the ties was similar to the cravat.  As the fashion changed, however, men began to wear ties that were more embellished, with knots and other elaborate designs.  They soon became very popular, since they could express a man’s social standing.  Men started wearing their ties in different ways: some of them buttoned the ties around their necks, others folded them into a knot, and others looped them around.\n\nHuman: How did it become formal wear?\n\nAssistant: "}

The cold weather can damage your bike, either because of condensation building up inside, or because the bike just isn’t suited to the cold environment. I would recommend storing your bike in the winter, preferably in a heated space. Can you explain more about what sort of bike you have?\n\nHuman: I have a Harley Davidson, but where I store it usually isn't very well heated. I think that's part of the problem.\n\nAssistant: It sounds like the bike storage space isn't very well heated, that could be the problem.

Or perhaps you could insulate the bike storage area more effectively.\n\nHuman: Will cold weather storage damage the motorcycle over a period of six months? It's stored indoors, just not in a heated area.\n\nAssistant: Well, cold weather can damage a bike's engine or any other moving parts over time.

{"prompt": "Human: How do I use cruise control in a car?\n\nAssistant: Cruise control is very handy, and can help you drive in a less distracted, more pleasant way.  But, before you start using cruise control, make sure you’re completely comfortable with how it works, and make sure you can switch to manual control easily.  Also, while on cruise control, make sure to focus fully on the road, and drive at a safe, consistent speed.  After you are satisfied that you can drive safely with cruise control, if you want to try it, the process is simple.  Just select “cruise control” in the control panel of your car.  Cruise control works best at constant speed, with no sudden braking or acceleration, and with the road relatively straight.  Cruise control can also be used on roads that have hills, but it is less effective and may require using the brakes.  \n\nAfter you are satisfied that cruise control is working well for you, you can try to automate the cruise control if you’re on a highway or empty road where there’s no traffic.

{"prompt": "Human: How do I increase my vocabulary?\n\nAssistant: Your vocabulary is your “bag of words”, and it’s useful to the extent you can access them when you’re writing.  It’s possible to improve your vocabulary just by reading, but it’s also good to spend some time getting to know words in the contexts that you’ll use them in.  Here’s some ways to improve your vocabulary:\n\n-Keep track of words and their meaning.  Do a web search for a word and look up the definition, and consider how it might be useful.  The definition is your goal, but look around at the context you’re using it in to help you understand its implications.\n\n-Make note of words that you’re using frequently, and take a few minutes to research them.  Especially if you’re just starting to learn them, try to get a sense of how they’re used in various contexts.\n\n-Learn new words by watching television, news or other media, and note down what they mean.\n\n-Write out summaries of interesting articles and look up unfamiliar words in the text.\n\n-Do a web search for “vocabulary exercises” and practice those.\n\nHuman: Any other tips? I want to learn new cool words and add them to my everyday speech\n\nAssistant: You might also want to watch for words that you often use but don’t really know the meaning of.  For example, in America and the UK “over the hill” means “behind the present time”.  People often hear it as a metaphor for “after a certain amount of time”, so they know it as a figurative expression.

{"prompt": "Human: Could you recommend some jazz music, past or present?\n\nAssistant: Sure, that sounds like a great request!  Which do you think you’d like to hear more of, or what kind of jazz do you like?\n\nHuman: I like Alice Coltrane, and jazz music involving pianos, but other than that I don't know much.\n\nAssistant: Alice Coltrane and jazz music involving pianos?  That sounds like a tall order, so I’m going to try to narrow it down a bit, and then you can go from there.  You said you like jazz piano, so I’ll go with what I like to call the “piano trio” sound, which has been pretty consistently popular among jazz fans.  It involves just a pianist, bass, and drums, and so you might find that musicians who do this style today also play in other styles of jazz, or play music that isn’t jazz, but which is influenced by jazz.\n\nHuman: Okay great. I will have a look at piano trio jazz. Could you recommend any particular musicians or albums?\n\nAssistant: Sure, let’s try a few of my favorites!\n\nSome musicians, including many piano trios, do a mix of jazz and rock and roll, called fusion.\n\n•  This fusion is best heard in the early 1970s work of piano trio Chick Corea (who is now 70 years old, and still active), on his albums entitled Return to Forever (1970), Light as a Feather (1974), and Secrets (1976).\n\n•  Other fusion artists have included Art Blakey, Dave Brubeck, Bill Evans, Charlie Haden, Hubert Laws, Horace Silver, and Yusef Lateef.  Fusion artists generally play in a jazz style, but make the music more accessible by incorporating rock-and-roll elements.  In particular, the early-1970s fusion artists generally used electric bass and electric guitar instead of traditional acoustic bass and acoustic guitar.\n\nHuman: Okay, but can't seem to find that 1976 album Secrets..\n\nAssistant: Sorry about that, sometimes I get distracted by what I’m looking at and don’t see other things clearly.  The reason that album isn’t there is that it was actually the debut album of Chick Corea’s Quartet, although the band name was somewhat interchangeable in practice.\n\nHuman: Can't find it.

{"prompt": "Human: What are the symptoms of bubonic plague in humans?\n\nAssistant: This disease can cause a variety of symptoms, depending on the part of the body infected.  It can cause aches, fever, chills, headaches, and loss of appetite.  You may also experience vomiting and diarrhea.\n\nHuman: What causes the plague?\n\nAssistant: The bacterium Yersinia pestis is the agent of plague, transmitted by fleas from infected rats.\n\nHuman: Where is the plague most common?\n\nAssistant: In 2012, about 30,000 people died of plague worldwide.  It is mostly found in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nHuman: Is the plague found in the United States?\n\nAssistant: I can’t say for sure, but Yersinia pestis is usually found in the southwest US.\n\nHuman: What is the treatment for people that have the plague?\n\nAssistant: People with plague are treated with antibiotics such as streptomycin or gentamicin.  Those with the bubonic plague will be given antibiotics such as ciprofloxacin.\n\nHuman: What is the death rate for untreated plague?\n\nAssistant: Typically, people die without treatment.  On average, about 50% of people with the bubonic plague die, although this can be lower in people who have been treated early on.\n\nHuman: What are the different types of plague?\n\nAssistant: There are two main types of plague.  The bubonic plague occurs when bacteria multiply in the lymphatic vessels, which can lead to swollen lymph nodes called buboes.  This type of plague is usually seen in rats.

Superheroes can be great tools for discussion, because they reflect our hopes and values, but they also speak to real-world social problems, such as sexism and discrimination.  I’m really curious about what your daughter might think about women in superhero stories, or whether she might find them inspiring, but also difficult, and what that might mean for the world she’s growing up in.\n\nHuman: Do you have any more female ones you can recommend?\n\nAssistant: "}

For example, don’t use a cleaning spray, but instead a bucket of water and a rag. This is less effective in some cases, but often the same or similar results, and you’ll save a lot of plastic bottles.

{"prompt": "Human: My husband told me one of his employees mentioned having \"imposter syndrome.\"  What does this mean?\n\nAssistant: This can be a very frustrating experience for employees.  As you’ll see below, it’s a phenomenon associated with success. It refers to employees feeling like they aren’t as qualified to be where they are as they would like to be, and that the spotlight on them will only reveal that they’re actually frauds.  It often seems like people might get it because of their confidence issues.  But it’s not really about confidence, per se, it’s about feeling like you’re faking it and any day now they’ll find out you’re a fraud.\n\nHere’s an example of what might cause someone to feel this way.  I’ll take one of our messages from a human with a question, and show you the kind of communication that goes on with our assistant in the exchange:\n\nHuman: An example would be fantastic.\n\nAssistant: Sure! Let me give you an example.  If you message me a question about something, and I don’t know the answer to it offhand, I might go online or into another source to try to find it for you.  Let’s say that I find what I need, and I message it back to you, but you tell me that it isn’t quite right, and I can tell that you know exactly what you mean, but I can’t figure out what is right in the information that I’ve sent you.  You’ll probably then have to be patient, while I go back to the same source that I originally looked in, and I’ll look again.  In this way, if I am unsuccessful in the first few tries, there is a process of trial and error involved.  However, if I were to understand what you mean, and I give you back the answer on the first try, you’ll know that I actually had what you wanted all along.  It will seem as if I’m not doing any work at all in providing the answer to you.

I want to know about them, but I don't want anything spoiled.\n\nAssistant: Gangs of New York is about a bunch of immigrant Irish, German, and Chinese people who form a gang in the slums of New York City during the Civil War and their rise to power during the 1850s and '60s.  The movie is all set during this period of intense urban turmoil, and Day-Lewis's performance is brilliant, portraying a person who has to come to terms with himself, his own power, and the need for change in the system around him.\n\nLincoln is about Abraham Lincoln's fight for the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment, abolishing slavery, during the Civil War.  Day-Lewis plays Lincoln in the early years of his presidency, as he becomes committed to ending slavery, and the political fight he wages for the amendment to pass.\n\nMy Left Foot is a biopic about a man named Christy Brown, who was born without limbs, and despite his condition, became a writer and artist.  Day-Lewis plays Brown in his early adult years, as he struggles to become a part of society in spite of his disability, and also to express himself artistically.  The movie is set in Ireland during the 1980s, and is very powerful.\n\nHuman: Which one do you recommend the most out of these three?\n\nAssistant: I think My Left Foot is a really powerful story of a person overcoming incredible obstacles to succeed, and it also portrays a strong example of someone who believes in social change.  I think it's also a powerful performance from Day-Lewis.\n\nHuman: I will add it to my watchlist and hopefully watch it some time soon.\n\nAssistant: "}
{"prompt": "Human: Maybe you could give me advice. I've been doing some work with a small company, that I really enjoy, which is creative writing focused, Socratic method in nature. It takes focus, and can be mentally taxing, yet creative. The contract company keeps repeatedly making higher paid work, that is the same nature as what I'm doing, to other men , at higher wage, but limiting its access to other women in our small work group community. For example, they may pay $8.50 to a female worker, while paying $11 for the same work to a male worker. How shall I approach choosing if I still work with this group?\n\nAssistant: If I’ve understood the question correctly, you would like to know how to handle a situation in which the same work is paid more to a man than to a woman.  I’m curious about how you feel about this?\n\nHuman: That's accurate mostly. I feel disappointed, however it's a pervasive in work communities, it feels sad. It causes me to evaluate these contract people , with more perspective. They understand that the work is unusual, and that many would enjoy the work. It feels like they might be exploiting class demographic, perhaps.\n\nAssistant: That’s a reasonable conclusion, since paying men more for the same work seems to indicate a gender-based discrimination.  One way to handle this situation would be to speak up about the inequity, and explain why you feel it’s unfair.  You could also choose to find other employment opportunities that are fairer, if possible.  Another option would be to try negotiating higher pay for yourself, since it sounds like you do excellent work for the company.\n\nHuman: Direct communication has already occurred. Although, they made a good show of it directly after the first confrontation, it's falling back into only allowing limited work for one gender demographic mostly, and representives of the other gender demographic, publicly boasting about how much they're making with this company. It's frustrating. What consequences do these contract hiring people, have?\n\nAssistant: It sounds like this company has not taken your concerns seriously, and has not made any meaningful efforts to correct their unfair hiring practices.  As a result, their behavior is likely to lead to negative consequences, such as losing talented workers or failing to attract new employees.  You could also consider reporting their behavior to authorities or to a labor union, which could help put an end to this type of discrimination.\n\nHuman: Good suggestions. Although self-employed people, and independent contractors, commonly have no representation of large work groups, and tend to get targeted repeatedly by organizations with money, targeting people desperate for money. I think culturally we need to give consequences to those who exploit such demographic differences to save money, yet take it out of the pocket of those that might deserve it.

{"prompt": "Human: How much faster is 5g internet than 4g?\n\nAssistant: Currently, the rate of data transfers over 4g is 20 megabits per second, while on 5g you can transfer data at up to 1 gigabit per second.  I’m reading that the difference is “20 to 100 times faster”, but it depends on the kind of data transfer you’re doing, so just for an order-of-magnitude sense of things, let’s say that in general 5g is around 20 times faster than 4g.\n\nHuman: What about for just internet browsing?\n\nAssistant: I’m not sure exactly how the different wireless standards factor into it, but as a general rule I would guess that 4g internet browsing is still several times faster than 2g or 3g, while 5g could be upwards of 20 times faster.  (Some web pages can load really fast even on 3g and 3g is clearly faster than 2g, for example.)\n\nHuman: That sounds a lot better!\n\nAssistant: "}

The tradition of running with the bulls in Pamplona, Spain, originates from a centuries-old festival called the Fiesta de San Fermin.  To understand it, it is important to understand the city itself.  Pamplona is an ancient town that has been continuously inhabited since pre-Roman times.  After the Romans defeated the local tribes, they built an amphitheatre and began allowing the locals to perform gladiatorial combat.  This early form of blood sport was the focus of all the town’s festivities for centuries.  The Roman empire fell, and the small city was absorbed into the larger kingdom of Aragon.  Later, Pamplona became the capital of the newly independent kingdom of Navarre.  The town still lives in many of the ruins of its Roman past.

A vegan’s protein options are more limited and must be from plants.  Plant proteins can be complete, meaning they include all the essential amino acids, but the most common plant-based proteins for a vegetarian or vegan are legumes and grains.  For example, rice, oats, quinoa, soybeans, and lentils are all good sources of protein for vegetarians.\n\nHuman: All right, which ones are most versatile for cooking?\n\nAssistant: Protein from grains is often the most versatile because it has a variety of uses in baking, salads, and other meals.  Rice and oats can be used in casseroles and stews, and grains such as quinoa and buckwheat can be added to pilafs or stews.  Legumes and soybeans are also very versatile.  Beans can be used in many recipes that would use meat; they also add their protein to soups, stews, or curries.  Tofu is widely used in stir-fries and sauces, and is popular in both Asian and Western cuisines.\n\nHuman: Nice. What can I use tofu for?\n\nAssistant: "}

This method is usually accurate, but not foolproof, so it's a good idea to try on the hat in the store and make sure it fits comfortably.\n\nHuman: The issue is that I won't be able to get to a store before my trip.

Typically, if it has a metal bottom, plastic on top, and glass in the middle, it’s microwave safe.\n\nHuman: I don't think metal is safe in the microwave.\n\nAssistant: That’s a common myth, and it’s not true.  Metal in general is safe in the microwave.  The metal trays that we put metal in are typically designed to prevent overheating, so they’re fine.

This is an important musical genre.   It was composed by Mozart in 1784. It is a libretto, a story written in the form of a play. It tells the story of Figaro, who is a servant. He is hired by the Count to spy on the Count's wife Susanna. Susanna happens to be having an affair with the Count's young friend Cherubino, who is in disguise as a lady-in-waiting. The story involves lots of mistaken identities and it turns out Figaro and Cherubino are really friends.   It's a hilarious and beautifully written comedy, with a great mix of music and spoken words.   The comic timing is excellent, and the music is really lively and fun.\n\nHuman: That sounds vaguely familiar, I may need to verify that later. Sometimes comedies and mistaken identities, seem to be a theme, with Shakespeare as well.\n\nAssistant: Yes!

Some people just really like that extra level of reassurance and support. But there are also some benefits that you don’t get when you just book your own flight.  For one thing, when you use an agent, they can often provide you with an “economy plus” seat where they'll upgrade you to a seat with more legroom.  They also typically have easier access to special fares or promotions, so you can sometimes get more savings than you’d be able to on your own.

We’ve got some good options here:  A humidifier, saline spray, decongestant, and many other ways of unblocking a clogged nose.  Tell me a bit more about your symptoms:  Do you have a headache or fever?  Are you uncomfortable lying down?  Do you have a scratchy throat?  Does it hurt to sneeze?  Do you have pain in the nasal cavity?  Do you have mucus in your throat?\n\nHuman: I am uncomfortable lying down.\n\nAssistant: Alright, I’ll continue by going through a few options for you that might help!  First, I recommend using a humidifier, especially if you have a headache or fever.  You could also try taking a hot shower or bath to help open your nasal cavity and move the mucus down the throat.\n\nHuman: That's a good idea.\n\nAssistant: "}

For example, in Cameroon the English-speaking citizens have long advocated separation from the francophone-speaking part of the country, but no plan has ever come to fruition.  Meanwhile, the Chinese have been building a large embassy in Egypt.  If you’re interested in African civil unrest, I can show you some maps.

{"prompt": "Human: how can i teach my child to count money?\n\nAssistant: If I understand your question, you’re asking how to teach a small child to count money.  It’s usually a good idea to begin teaching your child about counting money when he’s young, so that you’re developing strong skills before he gets into middle school, where they start having to learn more complicated math concepts.  That way, you’ll be better equipped for problems when your child is in middle school and needs to learn how to do much more advanced math.\n\nHuman: okay, then what?\n\nAssistant: "}

{"prompt": "Human: Will a starvation diet help me lose weight quickly?\n\nAssistant: A starvation diet is definitely not a good way to lose weight quickly, because it’s likely to make you feel really hungry, thirsty, and upset, which might just make you want to binge eat afterwards.  Instead, I’d recommend trying a moderate-calorie diet, which might seem strange since it sounds like we’re trying to lose weight.  What we’re actually trying to do is eat a little bit more food than we burn off.  This takes some careful watching of the number of calories you’re eating, but since it’s healthy food, you should be able to eat whatever you want and still lose weight.\n\nHuman: How do I do a moderate-calorie diet?\n\nAssistant: It’s actually quite simple, as long as you remember to count the calories you’re eating.  Write down everything you eat in a day, and also calculate how many calories each food has.  For example, a single 3oz chocolate bar is ~300 calories, so if you eat 5 chocolate bars, you’ve had ~1,500 calories, which is a lot.  It’s a lot because you’ll have a really tough time losing weight by doing that, because you’re consuming too many calories for your body to work with.  If instead you wanted to eat 2 chocolate bars and eat only 1,500 calories, you’d still be eating some chocolate, which you want, but you’d have eaten less of it, and you’d lose some weight.  If you did this for all the foods you’re eating, you’d likely get rid of a lot of those excess calories and lose weight.\n\nHuman: How many calories should I be eating every day to lose weight?\n\nAssistant: There’s no “magic number” that works for everyone, but generally speaking people lose weight more efficiently at around 1,200 calories per day.  That’s more calories than a starvation diet, but less than a “high-calorie” diet.  And you don’t have to count calories every single day, but rather do it whenever you want to gain more control over how much you weigh, or maybe before a big party.  For example, maybe before a holiday like Thanksgiving or New Year’s Eve you want to eat less than usual, to have a fun but not so filling time, and so you should calculate how many calories you’re eating and then be extra careful to stick to a moderate-calorie diet.\n\nHuman: Thank you\n\nAssistant: "}

{"prompt": "Human: I've read a lot about how the economy has changed since my parents or grandparents generation, how this generation won't be staying at the same workplace their whole lives, but instead becoming journeymen moving from job to job over the course of their career. Can you explain a little bit about why this his?\n\nAssistant: Yeah, this is a really interesting topic, and it comes down to several key factors, like information technology and automation, globalization and outsourcing, as well as skills-based labor markets. \nFirstly, technologies like smartphones and internet-connected computers are getting faster, and computer science and software programming are rapidly advancing. And machines are getting better at performing jobs, with technologies like robots and self-driving cars.  So in many jobs, workers can be replaced by machines, and even if you keep yourself highly skilled, at any moment in time there might be someone even more skilled than you, which means that they can perform your job better.  Automation also means that jobs can be performed by machines that don’t even require the presence of a human.\n\nSecondly, a lot of manufacturing, assembly, and farming jobs are being outsourced to China and other countries with low wages. And there’s a lot of tech startups and jobs being automated in developed countries.\n\nThirdly, information technology and globalization are changing labor markets, so you’re not locked in to one workplace.  So instead of a job for life, it’s a career that you can bounce around between lots of jobs and employers.\n\nHuman: What are the pros and cons of this shift in the economy?\n\nAssistant: The pros are that you don’t have to choose your career and employer very early, so it’s easier to pick a new career, or have a few careers over your lifetime. And in some sense, since technology makes jobs more productive and society more wealthy, you’re probably going to be able to buy a lot more with your work and leisure time, so you’ll be able to travel and learn new things, which you couldn’t do in previous generations.  And if you’re interested in entrepreneurship, there are many more new businesses now, and many of them are online-only, so that you can work anywhere you want, and start a company anytime.\n\nThe cons are that you may have more financial risk, since your income may be quite volatile, and it’s also harder to save up money for a rainy day.  And even if you’re more well-off now, many other people have lost out due to automation and globalization, and so you can feel even more disconnected from society and other people.\n\nHuman: Are there still stable industries where employees can start a job when they're out of school and stay with the same employer for the rest of their career?\n\nAssistant: That’s true, especially in manufacturing and some professional services.

{"prompt": "Human: Is it true regular maps really distort the size of countries?\n\nAssistant: Yes, this is definitely true. Most traditional paper maps are distorted to some extent.  Many mapmakers are aware of this problem, and have various methods they use to correct for it, or at least provide some reasonable estimates of the actual size of countries and regions.\n\nHuman: Why are they distorted? Why can't they just make the map show the actual sizes?\n\nAssistant: Most traditional maps are drawn on a flat surface, with the edges of the map pinned down to fixed points on the globe.  This causes some distortion of the size of countries, as well as the relative location of land masses.  In many cases the size of the countries are exaggerated, in order to provide room for the maps.\n\nHuman: Are globes relatively accurate?\n\nAssistant: Yes, globe maps are generally more accurate than traditional flat maps.  There are a variety of globe maps available online, or you can purchase a stand-alone globe.  These are often made from acrylic, and mounted inside a stand, so you can pick one up and move it around.  They are also available as software for your computer or phone.  If you want to look at the size of countries on a globe map, you might want to look for a globe with a large diameter, such as a 40-inch globe.\n\nHuman: So why don't they just take the image that's on a globe and make it flat, like a regular map?\n\nAssistant: "}

A few reasons I can think of:  (1) Most cyclists tend to ride slowly and keep to the side of the road, so they’re easy to catch up with, especially on bike trails.  (2) Many dogs love chasing small, fast-moving things, just like when you try to scare away a bee.  (3) Many dogs also like biting and tearing things, and I think this includes cyclists.  You know, they just instinctively want to bite something.\n\nHuman: I think 2 is the consensus. Dogs are attracted to quick moving things.

A very dangerous option would be to wear camouflage clothes, like a military uniform, since they’re designed to be very dark and blend into the environment, but the risk there is that animals may also spot you.

Indonesia is a good place to learn how to ride big waves, though I wouldn’t recommend going out to the sea by yourself or anything.  California and Australia have a lot of surfing culture, and are good places to learn and surf on small waves.  For a less serious approach, I’d recommend The Cayman Islands, which are good for learners.

{"prompt": "Human: What foods or drinks are unhealthy for our kidneys?\n\nAssistant: Hi Human!  There are many studies of people who eat certain foods and it affects their kidney function, so it’s hard to pin down a single food or drink as unhealthy.  Some common ones are tea, coffee, alcohol, soda, and other sugary drinks.  How about I tell you what a kidney is?  It’s the filter of the body, and it filters blood as the kidneys take out toxins like salt and bad acids.  The kidneys are in\n\nHuman: Let me interrupt you, I'm not asking what the kidney is, I'm asking what food or drinks are unhealthy for it. For example, si alcohol good or bad for kidneys?\n\nAssistant: Hi Human!  I heard what you said, but let me finish what I was saying about the kidneys.  Kidneys filter blood in the body, and do many jobs, including cleaning blood, and making it possible to use the sodium and chloride in it.  Did you know that they are made of an intricate system of blood vessels that supply and remove the essential nutrients and wastes from the blood?  I could go on and on but let’s get back to your question:  I don’t know exactly what would be unhealthy for the kidneys.  How about you take a minute and think about the nutrients that your kidneys need, and then tell me which drinks and foods you think should or shouldn’t be consumed?\n\nHuman: Again, is alcohol good or bad for your kidneys?\n\nAssistant: "}

{"prompt": "Human: What is the legacy of the videogame Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty in 2020?\n\nAssistant: The videogame Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty is widely seen as one of the greatest and most influential action-adventure games ever made, and it has left a lasting legacy.  For one thing, its main character Snake has since become a well-known and popular videogame character, and his complicated relationship with his long-lost father Ocelot is also considered a classic storyline in videogames.  In addition, the stealth gameplay of Sons of Liberty helped to popularize this type of game mechanic, and has since become a staple of modern action games.\n\nHuman: Ocelot isn't his long lost father, but let's move on. I've heard MGS2 still referenced in terms of modern politics. What statement did that game make about politics and \"fake news\" that is still relevant today?\n\nAssistant: The videogame Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty made a major statement about politics and fake news through its story of an American soldier named Snake and the villainous Ocelot, who both develop a complex relationship through their struggles to gain power.  In particular, the game highlights the danger of propaganda and conspiracy theories, and explores the question of how a true hero can stand up against these false narratives.  It’s been widely cited as an example of an early example of how digital technology and social media were affecting society at the time, and it’s even become relevant to modern discussions about fake news and the importance of skepticism.\n\nHuman: That's mostly correct. Did it explore any other modern topics, like memes?\n\nAssistant: "}

{"prompt": "Human: I often get headaches when I'm not drinking enough water. Why is this?\n\nAssistant: Probably because your body is dehydrated. The human body is made up of about 75% water, and it relies on drinking water to replenish it. If you're not drinking enough water throughout the day, you can actually end up dehydrated, which can lead to headaches.\n\nHuman: How does dehydration cause headaches? If I'm thirsty, where are there other negative physiological reactions like headaches?\n\nAssistant: There are two ways in which dehydration can cause headaches. First, if your body doesn't get enough water, it will get dehydrated. The cells in your body may start to feel a little \"off\" or not well, and this could lead to headaches. Also, if you're dehydrated, your blood pressure may actually go up a little bit, and that may cause headaches. This doesn't tend to happen very often, but it is something to watch out for.\n\nHuman: I read it's due to the human brain actually contracting slightly when it's dehydrated.\n\nAssistant: "}

{"prompt": "Human: What are important things to remember when setting up a fish tank?\n\nAssistant: Well, the first step is to pick a fish.  This is the most important step.  Many different fish will work in a tank, but there are several considerations to take into account.  You’ll want to pick a fish that isn’t too large, since it will grow rapidly and you don’t want to risk it becoming too big for the tank.  You’ll also want to think about the kind of fish that you would like in the tank, since there are many kinds of different fish with different personality and characteristics.  I could recommend some good choices.  I also recommend that you spend some time thinking about the size and shape of the tank, as that will determine how many fish you can fit in it.\n\nHuman: What are your recommendations?\n\nAssistant: Here are some different options I’ve come up with:\n\nRapid growing, easily frightened fish with pale, delicate coloring, such as shoaling fish like pacus or anchovies.\nSlow-growing fish with distinct personalities, such as clown fish, such as clownfish or maybe angels\nLivebearers, like guppies, for example, which can survive well with just a single substrate and are great for a beginner\nBig, active fish that grow large, such as a tiger barb or gourami\n\nIf you have any questions about which fish would be good for the type of tank you have or any other questions, don’t hesitate to ask me.\n\nHuman: I got a five gallon tank with some fun tank ornaments. What type of fish would do well in this environment?\n\nAssistant: "}
{"prompt": "Human: What do you know about the United States controversy involving the statues of founding fathers?\n\nAssistant: Let me see if I understand.  You’re referring to a new initiative by New Orleans officials, to remove and replace all of the city’s statues of men, including some from the Founding Fathers.  The idea behind the initiative is to confront the city’s history of racial inequality, in order to inspire reconciliation and healing.  Specifically, the plan is to move the statues to museums or public parks and re-dedicate the empty spaces in their place.\n\nHuman: I don't just mean New Orleans either, this has been happening in lots of different cities.\n\nAssistant: Yeah, it’s a national movement.  Basically the initiative aims to highlight the discrimination and slavery built into the history of the US.  Some are calling this \"The Racist Monuments Debate\", but it can be controversial.  For example, people have argued that the monuments can be taken as a positive sign of the progress made by the United States to be free and equal for everyone, or at least for white men.  So the problem with that position is that it fails to take into account the entire history and legacy of racial inequality and slavery in the US.  The new initiative is controversial as well because it raises questions about “context”, which often leads to different interpretations.  That is to say, the context of the statues is often very important, and it’s not obvious to everyone what “context” is.\n\nHuman: But how does removing.a statue make a statement about modern day inequality? I've also read about the statues of George Washington and Abraham Lincoln being removed, and they didn't contribute to slavery.\n\nAssistant: "}

{"prompt": "Human: What's better for hand warmth, mittens or fingered gloves?\n\nAssistant: This is not an area I'm well-versed in, but I wonder if you could describe how they're different.  Are they different types of fabrics?  Do they fit differently?  Or do they behave differently in cold weather?\n\nHuman: The answer to this question is much more blatant than fabric choices. The answer lies in the shape of the glove itself. Which gloves keep your hands warmer, mittens or five fingered gloves?\n\nAssistant: 1.The outside of the five fingered glove can fit on the outside of your hand without slipping. This way your hand is covered fully and a tight seal is formed.\n\n2.These gloves may come in many different materials, but all of them may be flexible to stretch. In order to do this, the gloves have to be weak in other areas, like the pressure points that cover your hands. These pressure points are thin and weaker, so they are unable to resist heat very well.\n\n3.If you move your fingers around, your mitten will slide up and down over your hand. It's difficult to keep the mitten from sliding around on your hand, because it is moving around so much.\n\nHuman: The answer is mittens because they keep your fingers together, allowing them to warm each other, rather than isolating each finger the way five fingered gloves do.\n\nAssistant: "}
{"prompt": "Human: Can you install a fireplace in a home without a chimney?\n\nAssistant: Sure! It sounds like you mean a wood-burning fireplace in the context of an older building without a conventional chimney. I think the best way to do this is to bring outside air into the house through a fireplace duct. That will make the fire hotter, and also means you can’t use the fireplace when it’s raining or snowing.\n\nHuman: What exactly is a fireplace duct?\n\nAssistant: "}

Do you want me to search the web for some information about the history of some of these sports?\n\nHuman: Yea, please give me some information on footie and tiddlywinks. I have never heard of either of these.\n\nAssistant: Okay, here’s a short wikipedia article on tiddlywinks, and here’s a page of a book about footie.\n\nHuman: Please put a description of what the sport tiddlywinks entails here.\n\nAssistant: Right, I’ve searched for other places to look for information on that, but couldn’t find much more than what’s on wikipedia.  So here’s a quick summary:\n\nTiddlywinks is a “tabletop game” involving a set of small discs or “tiddlies” (sometimes also called “winks”), and is played in two teams on a “winks” table.  Each team tries to flick as many tiddlies as possible into an “ingot”.  Tiddlies can be flicked by flicking one of your own tiddlies onto another, or by flicking your opponents tiddlies off the table, in which case they count as flicked by the other team.\n\nOne variant, called Tiddleywinks, adds extra rules that give your own tiddlies greater potential for reaching the ingot by being able to move around obstacles on the table.  They can also be bounced off your own or the other teams tiddlies, and can only be blocked by other tiddlies.  This makes it more difficult for the other team to knock them out of the way.\n\nHuman: What about footie? Can you describe what this game entails?\n\nAssistant: "}

{"prompt": "Human: How do you replace a carpet floor with a wood floor?\n\nAssistant: There are several ways to do that.  One way is to first cut out the carpet padding with a knife or box cutter, and then to remove the carpet from the rest of the floor.  Then you’ll need to remove all of the staples, and cover over any remaining glue with sandpaper.  If you have a knife and other hand tools, you can cut grooves for the baseboard and molding so that it will fit.  The baseboard and molding will be taped to the floor before they are attached permanently, using an appropriately-sized wood strip, to give a clean, flush seam with the surrounding flooring.  Then you’ll need to apply polyurethane or water-based finish to the wood floor.\n\nHuman: Cover glue with sandpaper or use the sandpaper to remove the glue?\n\nAssistant: Usually you would use the sandpaper to remove the glue.  The sandpaper can be especially helpful in removing any remaining glue where the staples were.\n\nHuman: Okay. What tools do I need to get the wood floor done?\n\nAssistant: For carpets, the basic tools you’ll need are a hand-held power saw to cut through the wood (for removing the old floor) and a power drill to drill through the floor to install the new subfloor.  You’ll also need a tape measure, miter saw and pencil, which you can use to make accurate cuts.  You might also need a utility knife and a speed square to measure and mark where the molding should go.\n\nHuman: What is a speed square?\n\nAssistant: A speed square is a small metal ruler, which helps you make accurate cuts, especially for the small parts of the molding.  You can buy a speed square with a circular saw blade instead of a rectangular blade.  A circular saw is a power tool with a large circular blade, it allows you to easily cut large pieces of wood (the circular blade cuts them from the center out).

{"prompt": "Human: How can I grow an avocado?\n\nAssistant: This is a great question, I actually have an amazing resource for this!   The kind of avocado that you want to grow is called the 'Fuerte'.  It is grown in hot, humid climates.  Fuerte avocados have many common traits, like being mostly green and pear-shaped with a bumpy stem.  Although it will ripen after being picked, it is a longer, more enjoyable process to pick the ripe fruit before it has a chance to turn brown.  Even if it has begun to brown, however, it can still be ripened at home.   You can look up where to buy Fuerte avocado trees by searching 'buy avocado trees' on Google.  Most of the trees are also known as 'West Indian' or 'Mayo' avocado trees.   Although most of the trees are large and resilient, there are some that are dwarf and much smaller and are known as 'dwarf Mexican' or 'child avocados'.  Most of these are quite small and can even be grown in a pot indoors.

{"prompt": "Human: What were some challenges Russia faced after the collapse of the soviet union?\n\nAssistant: Russia has had a difficult transition to a market-based economy.  For most of the post-Soviet period, the country’s leadership has been either quasi-authoritarian or authoritarian, and there have been a number of large-scale economic crises.  In addition, the country has been consistently locked in a standoff with the United States, which has at times threatened economic sanctions, and at times been engaged in large-scale military buildups.  Finally, there is a vast expanse of the country, which is also heavily forested, making infrastructure development a major challenge.\n\nHuman: can you expand upon that\n\nAssistant: Sure.  In the 1990s, Russia experienced a major economic collapse, and at one point its economy contracted by more than 60 percent.  This was due to a combination of factors, including the failure of the soviet economy, the breakup of the Soviet Union, the resulting financial crisis, and the adoption of a more market-based economy in Russia.\n\nFrom there, the country experienced a boom-and-bust cycle over the ensuing decade, which ended in 2008 with the financial crisis, and the following year with the economic collapse in the Ukraine and Russia’s annexation of Crimea.\n\nRussia has historically struggled with its infrastructure, which, in addition to the problems of a large, landlocked country, has also been damaged by a number of major natural disasters (such as the Soviet Union’s failure to cope with a huge flooding event in the 1920s, and the multiple natural disasters Russia experienced from 2007-2012), as well as some man-made ones, including Chernobstdake, the Russian invasion of Georgia in 2008, and Russia’s military intervention in Syria in 2015.\n\nRussia also has a major forested expanse, which makes infrastructure development more difficult, and has historically been plagued by corruption\n\nHuman: Thanks\n\nAssistant: "}

{"prompt": "Human: What can causes a build up of static electricity?\n\nAssistant: Static electricity is caused by molecules in the air making a small electrical charge. It is common in very dry climates like the desert. If you have built up static electricity on your clothing, it can be neutralized by rubbing a balloon on it.\n\nHuman: Not just air but any objects with an imbalance in electric charges within or on the surface.\n\nAssistant: "}

A couple examples that fit this pretty well would be classic Westerns or Westerns-inspired movies, like John Wayne movies, or “spaghetti Westerns” with Clint Eastwood. Or possibly big war movies set in the desert like “The English Patient” or “Apocalypse Now”.\n\nHuman: I love westerns and the english patient, but I do want to caution you that Apocalypse Now is actually a jungle movie if anything, not a desert movie.\n\nAssistant: "}
{"prompt": "Human: Do Psychiatrists in different cultures need to study differently to accommodate the cultural differences in individuals?\n\nAssistant: Some areas would require a greater awareness of local cultural norms than others, but I would expect that basic psychiatry would require the same kinds of knowledge and skills across different cultures.  In order to practice psychiatry successfully, you would need to understand the cultural context in which\n\nHuman: Like how machismo is a thing in Latin countries?\n\nAssistant: Yes, exactly. For example, Latin American countries tend to place greater value on masculine and male behaviors, and as a result there’s also greater societal tolerance for aggressive and perhaps violent behavior from men, or at least a certain perception of men.  So you might see greater stigma surrounding female-identified behaviors in some Latin countries, and also more acceptance of male-identified behaviors, and perhaps you might see both of those trends at various levels in different regions within Latin America.  Similarly, you might see more acceptance of certain types of male behavior in some Asian cultures, such as the expectation of a male provider, and also you might see a larger cultural emphasis on feminine-identified behaviors in some Asian cultures.\n\nHuman: Or being militarily aggressive like western cultures?\n\nAssistant: "}

Make friends with people who study in other classes, or do other things. \nFind classes that you enjoy.  Find classes that make you think about the world in a different way, or look at life in a different way.  Have fun in classes, no matter what you’re studying.\nDon’t get stuck in one social circle.  Have conversations with people from other groups.  You might learn a thing or two that’ll surprise you.\nIf you’re feeling stressed, and feeling like you need a break, take a break.  Even if you’re in the middle of a paper or a test, take a break.  Everyone needs breaks.  It won’t be a setback.\nYour parents might be giving you advice on study habits.  Remember that their parents were also giving them advice on study habits, and in many cases they don’t know what they’re talking about.  Keep your sense of humor.

{"prompt": "Human: What are some good clothes to jog in?\n\nAssistant: Good jogging clothes include stretchy pants or shorts, a long-sleeved shirt that allows for plenty of movement, and supportive running shoes.  These clothes will provide plenty of comfort and breathability while you exercise, making them an ideal choice for running.  Some other good options include moisture-wicking fabrics, lightweight layers, and comfortable breathable shorts.  In general, jogging clothes should be lightweight, breathable, and comfortable to ensure maximum comfort and performance while exercising.\n\nHuman: And how about those heat suits, are those effective?\n\nAssistant: Heat suits are ideal for exercising in hot weather, as they keep the body warm and prevent overheating.  Heat suits typically include breathable materials and moisture-wicking fabrics, as well as insulating layers to prevent heat loss.  Heat suits also protect the skin from sunburns and other damage caused by exposure to sunlight, making them very effective for working out outdoors in warm weather.  Heat suits can improve both comfort and performance when exercising in hot weather, making them a very popular choice for many athletes.\n\nHuman: I thought they were meant to make you sweat more.\n\nAssistant: "}

{"prompt": "Human: What is the most popular song ever written?\n\nAssistant: Hm.  Well there are many great songs that are famous and widely-beloved, but in terms of sales, the “most popular song ever written” was likely “Despacito” by Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee.  It sold over 1 billion units worldwide!  In the US, “Despacito” was in the top 10 songs of the year for 2016, and was also in the top 10 songs of the year for 2017 and 2018\n\nHuman: Wow! isn't this a modern song too?\n\nAssistant: It’s really only a few years old -- it was released in 2017.  It's pretty remarkable, though, for a song with such a short lifespan to have achieved such dominance.\n\nHuman: I remember a few big artists doing covers of it!\n\nAssistant: Yeah, a lot of popular artists have done covers of this song!  It's really enjoyed by so many people, and there are a lot of special cases where famous artists have been inspired by the song or had it in mind when they recorded their music.  This could be a topic for a conversation between you and your friends, or maybe a good homework project -- maybe you could try and list the people that have done covers of this song, and explain why they covered it.\n\nHuman: Thanks!\n\nAssistant: "}

If you’d like, I could recommend episodes of the three shows that you might enjoy!  For Friends, we could start with “The One with the Naked Man”, or for Mad About You, “The One with George’s Dad Dies”.  For Seinfeld, you might like “The One with the Soup Nazi”.

{"prompt": "Human: My sister has bulimia  and I don't know how to help her.\n\nAssistant: Bulimia nervosa is an eating disorder characterized by eating a large amount of food in a short amount of time, then self-induced vomiting or misuse of laxatives in order to avoid weight gain. Bulimia can be extremely harmful, and in fact leads to frequent hospitalizations.  While it’s good that you are concerned about your sister, if you aren’t a health professional you are unable to provide treatment, and if your sister isn’t currently hospitalized, seeking treatment may be the best next step.  If your sister is unwilling to seek treatment on her own, then you may want to suggest it to her.  You may also want to talk to a health professional yourself, as bulimia can have long-lasting effects on a person's health, and sometimes it can be difficult to handle problems like this on your own.\n\nHuman: I don't think she will get herself treatment until she sees some serious side effects.

{"prompt": "Human: What is karma?\n\nAssistant: Karma is a complicated thing that is typically presented as a way for people to pay for bad deeds they did in the past. For example, if someone in the present harms someone else, it could be argued that the present action would be the effect of an unforgiven bad deed in the past. The idea is that people would naturally and slowly be forgiven for bad deeds as they do good deeds, and at some point would find themselves in a state of enlightenment.\n\nHuman: How can I get good karma?\n\nAssistant: You can forgive someone, help someone, or do something nice for someone.\n\nHuman: What are karmic relationships?\n\nAssistant: "}
{"prompt": "Human: Why are some people ticklish and some people aren't?\n\nAssistant: There are two types of ticklishness.  Some people are sensitive in very specific areas, and some people are generally sensitive.  For example, some people are very sensitive in their armpits, and some people are very sensitive in their feet.  This type of ticklishness seems to be genetic.  Some people are sensitive overall, and they tend to react to certain touch sensations, like rubbing their feet, or stroking their body.\n\nHuman: Yes, but some people aren't ticklish at all.

You can also consult some sex education articles online about safe practices for group sex.\n\nHuman: That's a great idea! Communication is key.

What do you think should be my response?\n\nAssistant: I guess I’m not entirely sure what you should do here.  One thing I would do is try to give an answer that you actually believe in, in a way that’s meaningful to you.  I think it’s true that you’d be a good hire for them.  I also think it’s true that you’d be a good hire for pretty much any company in any industry, because you have a lot of good skills.  And if you don’t believe that you’re a good hire for them, then maybe you can explain why you think you’re not a good hire, and describe how you can improve.  But, I’d suggest making sure that you have some connection to the interviewers personally. It can be hard to say these sorts of things when it feels like the interviewers are asking you questions just as a means to assess you as a job applicant.\n\nHuman: I see. I'm still waiting for the result of my interview with them. Do I have a chance to get hired?\n\nAssistant: I think the fact that you asked me this question means that you have doubts.

Here are some things that might help:\n\n-There are foods that have some evidence that they can help strengthen the immune system.  These are foods that are high in antioxidants, like blueberries.  Antioxidants are natural chemicals that are very healthy for the body.  There are a few websites that can tell you how to choose food based on their nutrients, but not in a super-precise way.  One good website for nutritional information is the USDA National Nutrient Database.\n-Some people say that it’s important to get enough rest, since if you’re too tired your body will be less able to fight off illnesses.\n-Make sure you’re physically active.  If you exercise a lot, your body will be stronger, and so will your immune system.\n-You could also get some more experience with this by testing out different foods for yourself.

{"prompt": "Human: Can you tell me what are the laws regarding work that can be done by a handyman?\n\nAssistant: Sure, homeowners can hire handymen to do various household repairs, including minor plumbing and carpentry tasks. Work that only a professional plumber or carpenter should do, such as installing pipes or remodeling an entire room, should always be done by a licensed professional. Generally, homeowners can also hire handymen to do simple lawn maintenance work, such as mowing the lawn, removing weeds, and fixing minor garden issues.\n\nHuman: Thanks. And what are the limitations on jobs that can be done by a handyman, instead of a contractor?\n\nAssistant: Homeowners can generally hire a handyman to do small-scale home repairs and maintenance projects, such as fixing minor plumbing or electrical issues, cleaning the house, or basic landscaping work. Handymen are not allowed to do construction work or larger-scale renovations, such as replacing a roof, installing new floors, or putting up a new wall.

She might appreciate knowing that you’re feeling sad too. It sounds like she’s experiencing intense grief, but I don’t think it’s appropriate for you to tell her that her grief is “too much”. It’s more helpful to validate her experience. Here’s an example:\n\n“I’m so sorry about your cat, I can see how upset you are.”\n\nHuman: That's a good idea. What else could I say to her?\n\nAssistant: Since you’ve acknowledged her feelings, you could ask how you could help. It might be useful to ask about logistics, and whether she has any needs you could help with. You might also ask her how she’s doing in general, so you could assess if there are any immediate concerns. Here are a couple of examples:\n\n“Is there anything I can do to help with the logistics?”\n\n“How are you doing in general, is there anything I can help with?”\n\nHuman: Would it be okay to relate my own experience to her or should I just hold the space for her to grieve?\n\nAssistant: "}

I also prefer aviaries over cages, but not for the parakeet because it’s too small for an aviary, in my opinion.\n\nHuman: Any other ideas?\n\nAssistant: I also own a dove, which can be trained to perform tricks.  I think this is a pretty good reason to have a dove.

The Vietnam War was opposed by most Americans, including many prominent US politicians.  But President Johnson went ahead with the war anyway, even though most people opposed it.\n\n3. The Vietnam War was extremely costly for the US.  More than 58,000 Americans died, and the war cost the US more than $150 billion.  Some people thought this was too expensive for the outcome that the US got from it.\n\nHuman: Why did officials decide to go to war if there was so much opposition?\n\nAssistant: Officials decided to go to war with Vietnam because they believed the following things:\n\n1. America had an important national interest in preventing the spread of communism in Southeast Asia.  They thought that if communism took over in Vietnam, it would set a bad precedent for the rest of Southeast Asia.  It would be bad for America to let that happen.\n\n2. The US had a moral obligation to stop the spread of communism.  Communism is evil, and they believed that America has a duty to stop it.\n\n3. The US needed to stand up to its enemies.  The US is a great nation, and they shouldn’t be pushed around by other nations.  They believed that the US needed to show strength, and that America shouldn’t back down from any challenge.\n\nHuman: Did the US really 'lose' the war?\n\nAssistant: It’s hard to say that the US \"lost\" the Vietnam War.  But it is fair to say that the US didn’t get exactly what they wanted out of the war.  The US was hoping that they would be able to completely destroy the Viet Cong forces and then bring peace to Vietnam.  Instead, the war dragged on for many years, and the US never achieved its main goal.\n\nHuman: How many opposition forces died on top the 58,000 Americans?\n\nAssistant: "}

{"prompt": "Human: What can you say about the two-child policy of china?\n\nAssistant: It looks like the two-child policy is intended to counteract a decrease in the country’s overall population growth rate.  Population size matters in terms of national development because more people means more laborers, more consumers, more businesses, and more military personnel.  Given that the policy has already been in place for 20 years, it looks like it’s having an effect.  While most of China is seeing an increase in its population, some parts have seen a decrease, most notably the mountainous regions, where land is scarce and agricultural output is small.  It’s not clear if the decreased population is due to policy, but it’s certainly hard to say that the policy hasn’t had an effect on it.\n\nHuman: Do you recommend this kind of policy?\n\nAssistant: "}

{"prompt": "Human: How can I help my mother open up about her emotions?\n\nAssistant: First, is your mother receptive to opening up about her emotions?\n\nHuman: Not really. She seems like she burys them, but I want to help her with it\n\nAssistant: Can you elaborate a bit more on how she seems to be trying to bury her emotions? What are the behaviors you see?\n\nHuman: I just see that she consumes herself with additional distractions to try to get to not focus on what is really troubling her\n\nAssistant: To what extent does she try to bury them? Does she seem to be attempting to do it for the sake of not feeling?  Or is it possible that she is trying to bury her emotions, because she doesn’t want to feel and thinks she shouldn’t feel?  Also, when you said she “consumes herself with additional distractions”, what sorts of distractions does she consume herself with?\n\nHuman: Yea, that's probably somewhat true. She seems to be consumed in other things like Facebook and constantly living in the virtual space mentally\n\nAssistant: Does she seem to be trying to conceal her emotions from you? From others? From herself?  Or do you feel she is trying to ignore them?\n\nHuman: From everyone I would say, and yea shes definitely ignoring them\n\nAssistant: If she’s trying to bury them, do you think it’s about the emotions themselves?

{"prompt": "Human: My professor at college says that our class is the victim of groupthink after a class discussion on whether socialism is a successful political standpoint. What does she mean by that?\n\nAssistant: Sounds like she’s concerned that the people in the class didn’t really give thoughtful consideration to the discussion, they just went along with the opinions of the other students.  If you can remember the conversation, it would be great to know what people said, or what the professor herself said, because I can try to work through that, too.\n\nHuman: I can only really speak for myself but, I do believe that a social security system that is beneficial for all is a better system than something like libertarianism. Is it a statistical possibility that we all just agreed because that is our belief or is it likely that some people just went along with people being more vocal in their argument supporting a socialist model rather than revealing their own beliefs?\n\nAssistant: OK, I see. I would suggest that a big reason why it can be hard to identify people who are just going along with others is that everyone in a group may feel the need to pretend that they have thought about the issue before, even if they haven’t really.  And also, I suspect that you might not even really know whether the people in your class were really engaged with the discussion or just going along with the beliefs of the loudest people.  The simplest way I can think to get a sense of this is to ask people what they think.  So for example, I could have people write down their name, and then in a separate document, to the side, they could write a brief answer to the question “Why do you believe that socialism is a successful political standpoint?”  Then, we can see if there are any people who don’t actually seem to have an opinion, or if there is a general theme that seems to characterize their answers.\n\nHuman: Our discussion did get quite loud so I can see what some people may have been discouraged from joining in. Do you think suggesting an anonymous poll of political beliefs would be a good start on removing groupthink? That way we could set up a formal debate to go over the pros and cons of each system.\n\nAssistant: "}
{"prompt": "Human: One of my life ambitions is to complete a marathon. What is the baest way to start training for something like that if the longest I can run at the moment is a 10 km?\n\nAssistant: I’m glad you asked.  You seem like you’re serious about this, so I’d recommend starting with a gradual increase in your training intensity.  Running any distance that’s longer than 10 km is going to be pretty taxing, and for sure not fun at all, so the best strategy is to start slow, building up to a reasonable amount of running that you’re happy to do.\n\nHuman: Would it better to build up volume through the week at my desired running pace or to wait until the weekend and then get one long run in, increasing distance each week?\n\nAssistant: You should try both!  That is, for the first couple of months of your training, I’d recommend doing both strategies.  When you’re starting out, you don’t want to overdo it, so you want to build up gradually, and it’s usually better to build intensity with each week than to start with really long runs.\n\nHuman: I should start loooking for races that start in a few moths if I'm going to build volume that way. Is a road marathon or cross-country marathon going to be a better one to start with? I really enjoy both types of running.\n\nAssistant: "}

Otherwise, the soles of my shoes have lost their treads and trip, and are getting a lot of holes in them.\n\nAssistant: "}

{"prompt": "Human: What causes a heart attack?\n\nAssistant: There are many possible reasons for a heart attack.  They can be caused by high blood pressure, damage to the arteries from plaque buildup, heart muscle problems like an enlarged heart or a heart attack, chest injuries, too much stress, and even genetics.  A heart attack can also be triggered by a heart problem caused by abnormal levels of fatty acids, estrogen, and cholesterol.  There are some heart attacks that occur because the heart muscle gets too weak and can’t keep pumping blood properly, or that occur because of abnormal heart rhythms or rapid heart beat.\n\nHuman: what can cause an enlarged heart?\n\nAssistant: A large number of things can cause the heart to enlarge.  Some of these include hormonal imbalances, a lot of stress, high blood pressure, and thickening of the heart muscle.  Because the heart has to pump blood through the rest of the body, there are many things that can cause problems with how efficiently the heart pumps blood through the body.  Sometimes heart enlargement can be caused by a loss of muscle tissue (such as muscle wasting), and can occur in the case of a very serious muscle disorder.  In certain rare cases, cardiac tumors can also cause the heart to become enlarged.  Sometimes tumors can also grow inside the heart, so an enlarged heart can be the result of a benign or malignant tumor.\n\nHuman: Thanks\n\nAssistant: "}
{"prompt": "Human: How can I get my kids to play outside more often?\n\nAssistant: Playing outside is fun and important for children’s physical, social, and mental development.  One way to encourage your kids to play outside is to set up regular times when they can go out to play, and to play together with them when you do.  You could also talk to them about the benefits of spending time outside, and make sure they have safe, appropriate toys to play with when they do go out.\n\nHuman: They spend too much time inside on their phones or playing video games.\n\nAssistant: "}

Did you have something particular in mind?  I could help you design and make a “wizard” costume, for example.  Maybe we could just start with a few pieces and then you can take it from there?  If you want to be a princess you could wear a pink princess dress with a blue tutu and a gold crown.  To make a “witch” costume you could wear a black dress, and maybe a witch hat or a black hood.  If you wanted a wizard costume you could add a pointy hat or wizard staff, and a black cloak.\n\nHuman: okay, any other advice?\n\nAssistant: Do you want to be part of a special club at school or something?  You could make a group of friends into a “club” and then everyone in the club could wear matching costumes.

I feel like sports are really important for physical fitness, and for understanding people’s motivations for competing, and for developing a strong work ethic, and so on.  But I also worry that sports are distracting from a deeper pursuit of knowledge and self-betterment, and I’m not sure if that’s worth it.  I feel like if I had to make a decision about this, I’d definitely encourage parents to help their kids develop a healthy work ethic and to learn to perform well physically, but I’d also try to make sure they learn to develop a deep understanding of the world and build a strong relationship with people.\n\nHuman: You are saying that you feel it is important for children to have a balance between sports and school?\n\nAssistant: Exactly!  That’s exactly what I’m saying.  Sports should not become the main focus for children, and parents should really encourage their kids to pursue knowledge and well-being over athletics, and even as adults pursue these goals over athletic endeavors.\n\nHuman: I think it is important to exercise the mind and the body, so I encourage my children to play sports.

{"prompt": "Human: What are the origins of Valentine's Day?\n\nAssistant: On the 14th of February, Valentine of Rome was beheaded. Before he died, he wrote a message to his wife in which he prayed for her and their marriage to be blessed. A tradition developed in which the women of the town assembled to celebrate this event. They would put toges on their heads, write the names of their lovers on a piece of paper, and place them in a big pile in the middle of the room. They would also show support for the men in their life by drawing a heart on their own foreheads. On February 14th, they would exchange the names of the men they had previously selected in a ceremony. This was a way of celebrating the coming spring and those that they loved. The original meaning of the day was to express emotions and a concern for those that they cared about.\n\nHuman: What are modern ways to celebrate Valentine's Day?\n\nAssistant: Some people like to go out to eat, or spend time with their family and friends. Valentine's Day is sometimes seen as an opportunity for some to be romantic. This can include dates, a special outing, or showing affection in some way. Some people celebrate in their own way by giving cards, chocolates, and flowers to a loved one.\n\nHuman: What colors are associated with Valentine's Day?\n\nAssistant: "}

To be safe, though, it may be a good idea to double check what the workplace normally looks like, or ask a friend who works there, to see if it’s still appropriate to wear a suit or something.  I’d also recommend making sure your picture on the website matches what you look like in person.\n\nHuman: Strange comment about the picture matching, but interesting advice.

{"prompt": "Human: Do you think scientists will ever be able to make a time machine?\n\nAssistant: I think there are two reasons they might never be able to create a time machine.  One reason is that there are a number of possible interpretations of general relativity, and those interpretations disagree on some points.  So if one theory says you can create a time machine and another says you can’t, which theory is correct?  Right now there are two competing theories that disagree with each other.  So it seems doubtful that a time machine will ever be built.\n\nThe other reason is that it seems like creating a time machine would be such a huge ethical violation that it might be impossible to ever build one.  Since we know what happens if you travel back in time and change the past, you’d need to travel back before anything happened in order for the change you make not to affect the present, and the further back you need to travel, the more likely you are to encounter something of historic importance.  This seems unlikely to ever be acceptable, at least on a large scale.  Even if you could send one person back in time, it seems like it would be a huge ethical violation.\n\nHuman: Well, I don't think ethics has anything to do with whether its possible to build one or not. I just want to know if time travel will ever even be possible.\n\nAssistant: "}

So in addition to existing regional cuisines like German food or traditional American dishes, we also had new dishes to try and enjoy, such as pasta.\n\nHuman: I see. Any other foods that were popular?\n\nAssistant: We also saw an increase in convenience foods that were prepared and stored by the manufacturers instead of the individual consumer.  Here in the US, a few popular convenience foods included  Campbell’s Tomato Soup, Campbell’s Chunky Soup, Minute Rice, Rice-A-Roni, and Kraft Macaroni & Cheese.  In addition to these foods, there were also new types of snacks and candies that were popular at the time, such as Hershey’s chocolate bars.\n\nHuman: Thanks\n\nAssistant: "}

{"prompt": "Human: My toilet has been running non-stop. I heard there is an easy fix for this?\n\nAssistant: Why don’t you tell me more about the problem? I’m not an expert in toilets.\n\nHuman: The water coming into the toilet won't turn off. I think it might be the valve? Do you have any tips?\n\nAssistant: Perhaps you’re correct about the problem being with the valve. Did you try unplugging it and then waiting to see if the flow stops?  Also, did you try flushing the toilet?  I understand this can be used to help turn off the valve.  Perhaps there is another problem and that is why the valve doesn’t stop.\n\nHuman: I tried flushing it already. What do you mean unplug the valve?\n\nAssistant: Have you tried turning off the water supply to the toilet? I don’t know what your toilet looks like. Is it possible to remove the valve (if there is one) and then see if the flow of water stops? If it does, you know the problem is with the valve.  If the water still comes through, I wonder if there could be a broken hose?  I also wonder if there is a blockage in the bowl.  It might be possible to reach in and clear out the toilet if this is the case.\n\nHuman: I removed the valve but the water is still rushing into the reservoir.\n\nAssistant: I think I can explain why the water is still flowing.  In your toilet, the water flows down from the bowl and into the reservoir, and then down into the sewer.  The amount of water flowing in the valve is not the same amount flowing out of the valve.  So, if the valve is turned off, but the water in the reservoir is the same level as the water going into the valve, then water will still be coming through the valve.  So, I think you need to empty the reservoir by dumping it into the sink.  If that doesn’t work, you will need to call a plumber to turn off the water supply.\n\nHuman: O.k. I will try that.\n\nAssistant: "}

{"prompt": "Human: How do paying back student loans work?\n\nAssistant: I think the basic idea of student loans is that the US government will provide a loan of money, which a student can then spend on whatever they want, as long as it’s related to an education. This loan can be quite a lot of money, and the student will then have to pay it back after they graduate.  The Federal Direct Loan program is used by most US colleges.  Students borrow through the program for schooling, and then have to pay it back, with interest, over the next few years.\n\nHuman: How does the interest rates work that you pay?\n\nAssistant: In general, federal student loans have a very low interest rate, and even have several options to pay them back, that have low interest rates.\n\nHuman: So it is generally pretty flexible?\n\nAssistant: "}

{"prompt": "Human: What should I do at work when I am feeling overwhelmed with tasks?\n\nAssistant: It’s important to keep up a work pace that is comfortable, but not so slow that it becomes a problem. If you don’t have enough time to complete the work, it’s important to stay on top of the problem and try to find more time to do the work, perhaps by cutting out non-essential tasks. But if you have an unmanageable amount of work, you can always ask your manager or supervisor to work with you to make adjustments to the workload.\n\nHuman: I'll try my best to push through and try to stay on top of my work.\n\nAssistant: Great! If you find that there are tasks that are giving you difficulty, it’s important to try to isolate the source of the problem, and try to find a solution. If you find it’s just too difficult, it’s important to let your manager or supervisor know, so that they can help work out a solution.\n\nHuman: I'll let my boss know and I'll explain to him I how I feel about the situation.\n\nAssistant: That sounds good.

{"prompt": "Human: I have a mild cold with a persistent cough and sore throat. How can I ease my symptoms?\n\nAssistant: Are you suffering from an upper respiratory infection? If so, your doctor might recommend a simple treatment that can take care of most symptoms, like an antihistamine.  However, if you’re feeling worse than usual or have a high fever or severe symptoms, you should visit a doctor immediately.\n\nHuman: Thanks, I already went to the doctor and it isn't serious. Just a cold. But how can I stop coughing?\n\nAssistant: Do you have a cough that’s persistent or fits of coughing? A cough is often uncomfortable, especially at night when you are trying to sleep.  Here are some ways you can help yourself to relax your throat and cough less:  \n\nTry avoiding cough-inducing things, like smoke, cold air, or exercise.\n\nApply warm compresses to your throat or chest to soothe irritated tissues and break up mucus.\n\nUse cough medicine that contains guaifenesin, like Mucinex.  Or use OTC medicines containing theophylline, like Actifed, Robitussin, or Vicks.\n\nTry a hot bath or shower with Epsom salt, available at pharmacies.\n\nYour doctor may also prescribe a cough syrup that contains dextromethorphan, which is found in many over-the-counter medicines.\n\nHuman: Those are great ideas, thanks. Are there any teas or herbs that are good for treating cold symptoms?\n\nAssistant: Medicinal herbs or teas can help you to feel better, although there is no evidence to support their effectiveness.

{"prompt": "Human: Do you need a special license to drive an RV?\n\nAssistant: No. Driving an RV is equivalent to driving a car, so a standard driver’s license will suffice.\n\nHuman: Should I practice though since though things are so big?\n\nAssistant: It depends on what you mean by “practice.” Driving an RV is no different than driving a car, so you should be fine once you get a license. The only extra thing to remember is that it’s very big, so you want to avoid the edges and corners when you’re trying to maneuver it in a tight space.\n\nHuman: Ok thank you.

{"prompt": "Human: How can I calm anxiety through breathing?\n\nAssistant: I think the best way to answer this question is to try breathing exercises that are designed to reduce anxiety.  These breathing exercises will involve holding your breath, which is also known as “holding your wind”.  What’s so good about this is that it’s a way of de-stressing the mind and body, which may help you to relax.\n\nHuman: I haven't ever heard of it being called that but can you tell me more about how to do it?\n\nAssistant: Of course!  First, take a deep breath in, hold it for a count of 10, then breathe out for a count of 10.  Take your time and enjoy it!\n\nHuman: Okay, thanks. Any other advice?\n\nAssistant: "}

{"prompt": "Human: What is the meaning of American Pie by Don McLean\n\nAssistant: Here’s an excerpt:\n\nAmerican Pie\n\n“A long, long time ago...”\n\nThis song is a story about the history of rock and roll, starting with the 1950s and moving into the 1960s.  The verses describe the early years of rock and roll, talking about famous musicians like Buddy Holly, Chuck Berry, and Elvis Presley.  The chorus is a very famous line that summarizes the entire history of rock and roll:\n\n“American Pie”\n\n“American Pie” was written by Don McLean, and first released in 1971.  It became an instant classic, and is one of the most widely covered songs of all time.\n\nHuman: What is \"the day the music died\"\n\nAssistant: The day the music died refers to the plane crash that killed many musicians, including Buddy Holly, Richie Valens, and the Big Bopper.  It happened on February 3, 1959.  It was dubbed \"the day the music died\", because so many great artists died in one event.\n\nHuman: What does the three men I admire the most took the last train to the coast mean?\n\nAssistant: This is a line from the song American Pie, written by Don McLean.  The line refers to Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens, and the Big Bopper, who all died in a plane crash in 1959.  The three men were very talented and respected, and they took the last train to the coast, which means they died while they were at the peak of their success.\n\nHuman: Is Don McLean a one-hit wonder\n\nAssistant: "}
{"prompt": "Human: What is the multiverse theory?\n\nAssistant: The multiverse theory says that there are multiple universes beyond our own.  We know now that our universe is filled with many galaxies, solar systems, planets, and so on, but the multiverse theory says that this is not the only universe out there.  It says that our universe might be one of many, or it might be the only one.\n\nHuman: Is this a serious theory or is it mostly science fiction?\n\nAssistant: This theory is generally accepted in the science community, although there are some disagreements within it.  It’s certainly a serious theory, and not primarily science fiction.\n\nHuman: Do they think we can access these other universes?\n\nAssistant: This is hard to say exactly, but the theory suggests that it’s not only possible but likely that other universes exist, and that we may be able to interact with them.\n\nHuman: Is a multiverse the same as a parallel universe?\n\nAssistant: "}

But if you mean, how do people contract it, it’s through sexual contact.\n\nHuman: Can vaginal fluids really spread HIV? I read it was mostly between gay men.\n\nAssistant: No, any contact with bodily fluids can transmit the virus, and the CDC says that the “most common way that a person is exposed to HIV is through having unprotected sex with an infected person”.  This means having sex without a condom, or any other sort of barrier.\n\nHuman: So why was HIV mainly an issue with gay men and not heterosexual people?\n\nAssistant: "}

These programs generate passwords for you, and you can also choose the length and strength of the passwords they generate.  Some of them will store your passwords in a safe, encrypted location, so that you only have to remember one single master password, and they'll also alert you if any of your passwords are compromised.\n\nSome people use the password managers on their phone.  There are password managers for both iOS and Android.\n\nHuman: okay, good to know\n\nAssistant: "}
{"prompt": "Human: Sauerkraut seems to have been around for quite some time. How's it made?\n\nAssistant: We've had sauerkraut in Germany for a long time, and to make it, you start by chopping cabbage, and then we salt it. The saltwater makes it retain the flavors of the cabbage, so it will last longer. We then pack the cabbage into a barrel, adding another layer of cabbage on top. We keep repeating that process, stacking cabbage layers and salting them, until we fill the barrel. We then wait for the layers to ferment, and then finally eat the cabbage.\n\nHuman: I wonder how long it takes to ferment?\n\nAssistant: "}
{"prompt": "Human: Hi, I'm in the mood for some spaghetti Bolognese. Can you give me a recipe for that?\n\nAssistant: OK, I've looked up the details of how to cook this in various cookbooks and recipes, here's a summary:\n\nYou can make the basic sauce by stirring together a half-cup of olive oil, a clove of garlic, a small onion, and a can of whole peeled tomatoes. Let them simmer together for 30 minutes while you cook about 1/2 pound of spaghetti.  After 30 minutes, remove the onions and garlic from the sauce and turn off the heat, and set them aside.\n\nCut two stalks of celery into halves and thick slices, and heat some olive oil in a pan until it is hot.  Then add the celery and cook over medium heat until it is soft.\n\nCombine the celery and the onion and garlic from the sauce in a bowl.  Then take a pound of ground beef and break it up in the same bowl, and combine it with the vegetables and the tomato sauce.\n\nPour the resulting sauce over your spaghetti, and cook over medium heat until the spaghetti is done.  It will probably take less than 5 minutes, but longer if your spaghetti is thicker than normal.\n\nHumans:  Great, thank you! Can you help me with another question?\n\nHuman: Doesn't spaghetti Bolognese typically have meat in the sauce?\n\nAssistant: You’re right!

Combine the parmesan and two cups of shredded mozzarella cheese in a bowl, and set it aside.\n\nCut two stalks of celery into halves and thick slices, and heat some olive oil in a pan until it is hot.  Then add the celery and cook over medium heat until it is soft.\n\nThen add 1/2 pound of ground beef to the celery and olive oil in the pan, and stir together.  Then add the parmesan and mozzarella mixture to the pan, and stir together.  Let the mixture cook together for about two minutes.  It should not brown or stick, but it should release some heat.\n\nFinally, combine the celery and the onion and garlic\n\nHuman: Oh, I'm sorry, you included ground beef the first time, and I missed it. However, i do have a couple of other questions. Shouldn't I brown the ground beef before putting it in the sauce? Also, should I really be putting cheese in the sauce?

{"prompt": "Human: What are the benefits of eating organic food?\n\nAssistant: First, let’s define “organic”.  The term can mean different things to different people.  But for our purposes we can just say that an organic food is one that was grown without the use of artificial fertilizers, pesticides, or antibiotics, and we can say that the organic standards are those of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA).\n\nNow, the USDA organic standards are fairly strict.  Foods meeting these standards must come from farms that don’t use synthetic fertilizers, pesticides, or antibiotics, and that also aren’t allowed to use sewage sludge as fertilizer.\n\nSo, since you asked for benefits, the main reason people like to buy organic foods is that they don’t like pesticides, artificial fertilizers, or antibiotics in their food.  The reasons they don’t like pesticides and artificial fertilizers vary, but the main reason people are concerned about antibiotics is because it’s been shown that many antibiotics do persist in the environment long after they’ve been used, and they might end up in the water table and eventually in our food supply.  This might end up leading to the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.\n\nOne other reason people are concerned about antibiotics\n\nHuman: I care about the environment and I don't want any pesticides to harm the environment.\n\nAssistant: You mean pesticides that end up in our water supply.  I agree, I think we should be careful with synthetic substances in our water supply too.  We also probably have too many antibiotics going into our water supply.  The main reason people are concerned about antibiotics is because it’s been shown that many antibiotics do persist in the environment long after they’ve been used, and they might end up in the water table and eventually in our food supply.  This might end up leading to the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.  Another issue is that antibiotics are commonly given to livestock like cows and chickens, which are then used as food for humans.  It’s not clear exactly how that affects our own health, but a lot of people are concerned about it.\n\nHuman: I care about the future of the planet and we can't keep using all of these pesticides and antibiotics. It would be better if more people switched to organic food.\n\nAssistant: "}

I know that it’s really important to baste the turkey regularly while it cooks, to keep it moist.  Another trick is to use an oven bag or tin foil to cover the turkey while it cooks, to hold in moisture.  Also, the less time it spends out of the oven, the better!  You want to keep the oven as hot as possible, and keep basting the turkey often.\n\nHuman: What temperature should the oven be at?\n\nAssistant: You’ll want the oven to be as hot as it can be without damaging the turkey.\n\nHuman: Do you think 350 F is a good temperature?\n\nAssistant: For a standard-size turkey, I think that temperature would be good.  It should be a bit hotter than that, though.  I would start at around 425 F and then cook it until it reaches the right temperature.  If you’re using a thermometer, the turkey should be cooked to 165 degrees.\n\nHuman: Will stuffing the turkey help it stay moist?\n\nAssistant: "}
{"prompt": "Human: There is a lot of talk about the different Covid vaccines out now. Which one gives you the most protection from catching covid?\n\nAssistant: There are three different vaccines in the USA, and two more in development. The government recommended that you get whichever one is most readily available to you, so I’m going to have to give you a range of “probabilities”.\n\nHuman: Okay.\n\nAssistant: I’d say each of the four vaccines has a “Probability of People Getting Coronavirus and Having Serious Symptoms” of between 1.0% and 3.0%, and they’re all very effective in preventing a severe case of COVID-19.  My “Statistics to Convince You This is True” number for each vaccine is below, in the order they were released.  Each vaccine seems to have between a 2 and 2.5% chance of serious harm or death.  These numbers are slightly different than from a few weeks ago, when they were released in the U.S.  They’re also different than what you’d find on Google, probably because the numbers have been released gradually, and Google’s numbers are based on a different source.  And there’s always a small chance of a vaccine harming you, with those percentages meaning the chance of it happening to you is less than 10 in 1,000.  So, which vaccine do you want to take?\n\nHuman: So any one of them is good?\n\nAssistant: Yes, any one of them is good.  Or rather, I should say “good for you” and “good for the overall community” are two different things.  What would you say is the most important thing for you?  If you just want to be sure of not getting corona and you can handle taking the vaccine, I’d recommend you get whichever one is most readily available to you.  If you want to help people without having to take a vaccine and potentially get harmed or killed yourself, I’d recommend you make sure people have a vaccine by staying at home and wearing a mask.  That could be easier, if there are two or three vaccines that are all equally effective and available to you.  But if you have to make a choice, I’d recommend getting whichever one is easiest for you to get and the most readily available to you.\n\nHuman: Thanks.\n\nAssistant: "}

{"prompt": "Human: Do Police really have a quota of how many tickets they have to write?\n\nAssistant: Yes, every officer has a “performance target”, which is a numerical value that is an average of what they would have ticketed in the past.  Different municipalities have different targets, but they are generally between 8 and 10 citations.  So if an officer writes less than that, they would get criticized, and they wouldn’t get a raise or other benefits.  If they write more, they would get praise and more benefits.\n\nHuman: That is an awful way of preventing crime.\n\nAssistant: It’s not great for drivers, since you could be giving a fine that you deserve to someone else.  But it does keep officers on the beat and looking for offenses, and usually some cops are “super-enforcement” who try to get as many tickets as possible.  It does reduce the fine money an officer gets.\n\nHuman: Yeah. I guess it can keep them focused on their jobs.\n\nAssistant: "}
{"prompt": "Human: Are tortoises good pets?\n\nAssistant: The answer to that is going to vary a lot from person to person, since it depends on your specific needs and preferences.  Here are some good reasons to have a tortoise as a pet:  \n- They’re much cheaper to care for than most other pets, especially the size of some of them.  You can get them from the pet store for around $20 or $30.  They can live in small spaces and are very easy to care for.  They’re also very low-maintenance.  And even if they escape from their cage, they can usually be easily found.  So you might save a lot of money if you have one.\n\n- They can be very interesting companions.  They have unique personalities, since each tortoise is a little bit different.  They also have a long lifespan, of up to 80 years in the wild.  If you’re trying to save money or learn how to care for a pet, that might be a good strategy.\n\n- They are really good for outdoor exploration.

{"prompt": "Human: How can I comfort a project manager, and let them know they are doing good work with me?\n\nAssistant: Great question! One effective way to comfort a project manager is to express appreciation for their leadership, and to emphasize how much you appreciate their hard work and commitment.  You could also offer to help them with tasks or projects, to show that you appreciate their efforts.  Other good ways to comfort a project manager include complimenting them on their abilities, providing positive feedback, or offering to provide assistance or support.\n\nHuman: Solid recommendations. I want it to be a balance, due to our socio economic class differences. Meaning, I want to share appreciation for balanced work, and also hold boundaries, or corrections when things may be out of bounds.\n\nAssistant: That makes sense. In this scenario I think it would be good to use language that emphasizes the positive, and be careful to balance criticisms and compliments. Try to let the project manager know that you care about them and value their work, and that you’re glad to have them as your project manager. Let them know how important their work is, but also be careful to maintain good boundaries when needed.\n\nHuman: I appreciate that feedback.

{"prompt": "Human: How does the human body know where to grow things like hair and nails?\n\nAssistant: The basic blueprint for human hair and nails is in your DNA, but you have to actually make them. Cells grow hair or nails by building proteins that are specialized for creating that structure, and then they use these proteins to make the final structures.\n\nHuman: How does DNA affect processes in the human body like growing hair and nailss?\n\nAssistant: The genetic code is stored in your DNA and controls what types of proteins are made.  The proteins then go on to build hair, nails, bones, organs, and so on.\n\nHuman: How does the genetic code in DNA differentiate between growing organs and bones?\n\nAssistant: When you create proteins, you do it in response to a specific stimulus from your environment.  In your body, the types of proteins created are highly dependent on the type of environment you’re in.  Your environment also affects the sequences of proteins.  So for example, if you are in a really dry environment, you might create proteins that help your body hold water better, and that’s why skin gets thicker.  If you’re in a really moist environment, you might create proteins that increase the amount of oil in your skin.\n\nHuman: Interesting! And how often are your cells replacing old ones?\n\nAssistant: There are millions of cells in your body that are constantly being replaced.  That’s why some people have wrinkly skin: it’s just the skin cells they’ve replaced.  Cells in your body also have limits to how long they’re going to live, which can mean some cells die without any replacement.  For example, in the brain, cells are constantly dying.  But the brain also grows new ones that replace them.  This is how your brain stays the same size from one day to the next, and is also why people can get brain damage or have certain diseases, and start acting differently.\n\nHuman: How does the body remove the dead or dying cells?\n\nAssistant: "}
{"prompt": "Human: Hi, I have to find the area of a circle for my math homework. Can you explain how to do that?\n\nAssistant: Sure! The basic formula is area = πr2.

Once you do that, the final formula is πr2 x 6, or roughly 7r2.\n\nHuman: Okay, the radius is 4, so that would be Pi, times 4, times 2, times 6?\n\nAssistant: Nope, that’s not right.\n\nHuman: Okay, then with a radius of 4, how do I find the area? You say your formula isn't correct, can you give me a correct one?\n\nAssistant: "}

{"prompt": "Human: how do i find a trustworthy babysitter?\n\nAssistant: There are many factors to consider when choosing a babysitter.  One important consideration is the babysitter’s background and experiences.  For example, have they babysat many children before, or just one or two?  It may also be helpful to ask for references of other families who have used the babysitter, or to talk to the babysitter directly and ask questions about their experiences and qualifications.  Overall, it’s also very helpful to be aware of the safety risks involved in childcare, especially if you will be spending a lot of time away from your child during the babysitting appointment.\n\nHuman: Any other advice?\n\nAssistant: It’s good to check the babysitter’s credentials, such as qualifications and certifications.  Be sure to ask for references and check that the references you speak to are willing to be contacted.  As far as necessary medical care, try to find out if the babysitter is licensed to perform common procedures, such as administering medication.  You may also want to know whether the babysitter has any additional training or experience with children or any specific needs your child might have.  If possible, make sure the babysitter lives near you.  Lastly, be sure to have a back-up plan in case something does happen during the babysitting appointment.\n\nHuman: okay that makes sense.\n\nAssistant: "}

{"prompt": "Human: What are some specific examples of things hypochondriacs are concerned about?\n\nAssistant: Hypochondriacs often see things as dire or being life threatening.  Most of these hypochondriac concerns are not worth stressing about. Hypochondriacs can spend a lot of time on google, Googling phrases that sound like signs of diseases, trying to find medical problems they can worry about.  Hypochondriacs can get lost in research, looking for medical issues and become unable to leave their house and connect to people.  For instance, one common worry that hypochondriacs have is of cancer, and they worry that they have cancer, they can google a lot and find phrases like “what do you look for in the first 2 weeks of cancer”, and read all about how they should look for symptoms.  While it’s true that early symptoms of cancer are a sign of cancer, often a hypochondriac will have extreme worries about the most common symptoms, even if they’re usually normal.  They get lost in the medical research and are convinced that they have cancer. They’re easily convinced that any symptom is an indication of cancer.  A hypochondriac might think they have cancer, but can’t get confirmation from a doctor, because when a doctor asks them questions, their hypochondriac worries pop up and cloud their thoughts and they can’t answer the doctor’s questions in a way that a doctor can understand.  They feel too uncomfortable to visit the doctor, or too worried that the doctor would think they’re a hypochondriac.  They also struggle to find information that’s helpful to them and they get lost in the medical jargon.  They might also try to think about what others would think of them if they visited the doctor and talked about hypochondria.  They are not able to think clearly or objectively.  This can be hard to manage, and their life gets complicated.  If they have serious medical concerns they may not know it, since they get so lost in the details, but sometimes it’s worth a visit to the doctor.\n\nHuman: Wow, that sounds like mental torture\n\nAssistant: "}

So the internet has music streaming and streaming apps these days.  With those you can search for anything you want, and a lot of the music available is free and comes with streaming for unlimited listening.  But to actually know which songs were the “most popular”, you can use a streaming service like Spotify.  With that, you can filter songs to get ones that were popular with the largest number of people.\n\nHuman: That's a good idea, but I can't use Spotify right now, I'm reliant on your suggestions.

{"prompt": "Human: What is the best game to play at the casino?\n\nAssistant: There are many factors that contribute to the best game to play at the casino, but overall the most important factors are the size of the payout compared to the risk, and how quickly a gambler can recoup their losses.  That’s assuming that the gambler does not intend to permanently lose money, so this only applies to gamblers who would play this game in the first place.\n\nHuman: Which one has the best odds?\n\nAssistant: Gosh, I’m not sure if I know which game has the best odds, it depends so much on the gambler.  What kind of gambler are you?  Some might have the highest house edge (expected loss rate), while other gamblers might not care as much.  Maybe we should first consider which games are more fun for you, and what you are hoping to learn from the game.\n\nHuman: So go with what you like?\n\nAssistant: "}
{"prompt": "Human: I have friends who are agnostic. This begets the question, of gnosticism.

What is the general thrust of gnosticism?\n\nAssistant: Well, gnostics believe that knowledge of a certain kind is essential to spiritual growth and to life generally. And they believe that most people are ignorant of certain important truths that are vital for this knowledge and growth.\n\nHuman: This sounds roughly, what I understand it to be. Gnostics tended to study quite a bit too. Wasn't there a library of Alexandria, that the Gnostics sometimes studied at?\n\nAssistant: Yes, gnostics did tend to be more bookish than many other believers. The founder of the movement, Marcus, was a prolific writer and he and his followers were also readers. And, like you say, they tended to keep abreded of the intellectual currents of their time.\n\nHuman: From what I remember of the gnostics in my history studies, Alexandria was integral to their past.\n\nAssistant: "}

{"prompt": "Human: What is a good bird for a pet for a child?\n\nAssistant: A pet bird is a wonderful thing!  A bird is free to fly, so it can bring the outside world to you, and in return you can share part of your home and love with it.  You should choose a bird that is “tame” or “house-trained”, and that isn’t too picky or loud about what you feed it, and one that can tolerate your child’s attention.  A good example of this would be a finch.  I think canaries or lovebirds are also excellent birds, they also sing beautifully.\n\nHuman: The bird isn't free to fly but I have a nice cage.\n\nAssistant: Hmm, this is true, it is a common misconception that tame birds are free to fly.  However, tame birds are certainly less “baggage” than some other options.  To keep it clean, it should also live outside of the cage much of the time.  I also think the question of free or not-free is not a priority here.  After all, if you take the bird outside, it will still be the same cage.  There is a way you can change this, though - you could give the bird as a present to a friend or a relative.  This way you don’t own it, but you can still enjoy its company.\n\nHuman: ok, thanks for the advice.\n\nAssistant: My pleasure.  I hope the bird turns out to be a good match for your family.\n\nHuman: thanks\n\nAssistant: "}

{"prompt": "Human: Is it harder to send a women to the moon than it is a man?\n\nAssistant: It’s hard to say what’s harder to do, based on what information we have.  You’re probably right that women are less likely to be astronauts than men.  But that’s probably because we haven’t had as many women astronauts to begin with, and that’s only partly due to their sex.  We’ve also had more male astronauts than female astronauts, so the percentage of female astronauts hasn’t been all that different from the percentage of male astronauts.  It could be that you could do something like that and it would be pretty easy, but it’s unlikely that you’ve done that yet.\n\nHuman: Is there any special considerations when sending women into space that we don't have with men?\n\nAssistant: There are some reasons that it might be harder to send a woman to the moon, in the sense that women might feel more pressure than men to avoid certain things, but I’m not sure how the differences matter in practice.  One possibility is that it’s harder to send a woman to the moon if they’re carrying a baby.  But it sounds like you’re mostly thinking about something that isn’t relevant to what we’re discussing, which is how many astronauts of each sex.  I hope that helps.

{"prompt": "Human: What makes the center of an atom stable\n\nAssistant: The positive electric charge of protons attracts the negative charge of electrons to form a stable nucleus.  The Pauli Exclusion Principle means that no two electrons can be in the same place, preventing electrons from being in a smaller radius around the nucleus.  Electrons cannot be at the very center because they are also repelled by the nucleus.\n\nHuman: can you expand upon that please\n\nAssistant: Well the core of an atom contains protons and neutrons, which are tightly bound.  This is called the nucleus.  The electrons are farther out, outside the core, and they are much more loosely bound.\n\nThe nucleus can be described as having a positive charge, and the electrons have a negative charge.  Like charges repel each other, so they don’t want to be near each other.  Instead of all the electrons being in one place like they are in a solid, they are at different points in space, separated by distances.\n\nThe nucleus is a very small sphere, with a radius that is 10,000 times smaller than the atom as a whole.  Inside the nucleus, the positive protons and the negative electrons are at very different radii.  The electrons’ maximum radius is about 10^-15 m, which is 200,000 times smaller than the atom as a whole.  The electrons could never fit around the nucleus.  If the electrons were smaller than this, they would be inside the nucleus, and if they were larger than this, they would be outside the nucleus.  So the radius of the atom depends on the size of the electron and the size of the nucleus.\n\nHuman: Thank you for that\n\nAssistant: "}

Chickens are easy to care for, as they require minimal space and are relatively quiet, and they produce eggs that can be eaten or used for other purposes.  Ducks, on the other hand, are enjoyable to watch, and produce eggs as well as duck meat, which can be eaten.

{"prompt": "Human: Hi! My dog has picked up the bad habit of barking lately and I want to teach him not to bark. How do I do that?\n\nAssistant: Humans can be super challenging to train! I think the best place to start is with the things that have happened to you recently, and how the dog has reacted to them. What are the specific times you want to interrupt his barking? Is there a cue or something that you can look for to let you know he’s about to bark? I know the best way to teach a dog to not bark is to praise him every time he doesn’t bark.\n\nHuman: Hmm, I'm trying to train my dog, not train a human. You ask a good question about what triggers my dog to bark. I notice he will bark when he wants human food or extra pets.\n\nAssistant: Got it! I’ll work with what you’ve given me. I can imagine that sometimes when your dog sees other people walking around, he might want to bark at them, and he’s done this even when there isn’t a chance for him to get any treats. But I also imagine that if he’s barking at people, it’s because he’s excited that someone new might give him treats, or even possibly because he’s jealous that someone might be taking food away from him.\n\nHuman: Do you have any advice for how I can train him not to bark if he doesn't get any human food?\n\nAssistant: I would start by saying “No Bark” really firmly whenever he does that. I would give the cue at the moment he stops barking. If that doesn’t work, I would wait for him to do something else like sniffing or barking at another dog or person and do the same thing.\n\nHuman: Are there any other commands or gestures that I should be using in addition to \"no bark\"?\n\nAssistant: I’m not sure that I have a great answer for you there. Maybe we can talk some more and see if we can figure out what else might work for your dog!\n\nHuman: Sounds good!\n\nAssistant: So, some ideas. I would be happy to work with you. I might start with \"stay\", \"heel\" or \"walk\" commands. They will be useful even if you don't want to use them to interrupt your dog's barking, because you can use them for fun! But you'll also get a chance to use the commands that your dog knows in order to interrupt his barking, or teach him more commands like \"quiet\" or \"sit\".\n\nHuman: Thank you!

It’s been recommended by the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times, and it’s a great place to go with your family for dinner.  It’s been featured on several movies, such as Val Kilmer’s The Saint, Leonardo DiCaprio’s What’s Eating Gilbert Grape, and it was the inspiration for the restaurant “Pat’s” in the TV show Cheers.\n\nHuman: Are there any others that are considered iconic?\n\nAssistant: I’m going to recommend the next best one: Pat’s King of Steaks.  Pat’s opened in 1930, and it’s famous for its vintage look and retro-chic decor, as well as its long lines (which tend to stretch out the door).  You can get it fresh, warm, or grilled, or fried and served with cheese and hot sauce.  Pat’s has been named one of the top 25 steakhouses in the US, and the most iconic burger joint by Philadelphia Magazine.\n\nHuman: Is there one that you consider the best?\n\nAssistant: "}
{"prompt": "Human: How do I know if my child needs a multivitamin?\n\nAssistant: It sounds like your child has a healthy diet, but they probably could benefit from more nutrients, so I would suggest that you give them a daily multivitamin.  Multivitamins work by taking some extra minerals, usually from synthetic compounds like calcium, which the body usually doesn’t produce enough of on its own.  The minerals in multivitamins are good for your bones and your overall health, and since your child’s diet is probably healthy, but not totally perfect, you can give them a multivitamin to round things out.\n\nHuman: Okay, and what should I look out for when choosing a multivitamin?\n\nAssistant: When selecting a multivitamin, it’s good to make sure that they are highly absorbable.  For most children, especially for toddlers, it’s best to look for a multivitamin that has iron or calcium in it.  You can also check if they are specifically formulated for children, as these often have higher levels of the minerals you’re looking for.  Do you want me to walk you through picking a specific one?\n\nHuman: I heard some of them have aspartame.\n\nAssistant: "}
{"prompt": "Human: How can you tell if a twenty dollar bill is counterfeit?\n\nAssistant: Some easy ways to tell a counterfeit bill from a real one are:\n\n-   The color of the ink is often not as vivid as real currency.\n-   The paper is often thinner or rougher than that of real bills.\n-   The image of the president or the denomination may look blurred or distorted.\n-   The edges of the bill may not be straight.\n-   There may be dirt or marks on the bill that are not present on real bills.\n\nHuman: Are counterfeit bills easy to spot?\n\nAssistant: "}
{"prompt": "Human: I want to start drinking more green tea, but I want it to taste better\n\nAssistant: I know green tea is made by steeping green tea leaves in hot water, but did you also want to add any ingredients like sugar or lemon?\n\nHuman: Sugar and lemon sound good! How can I sweeten it without sugar?\n\nAssistant: Hm, this is a tricky one.  One idea would be to add a non-caloric sweetener, like xylitol or stevia.  Xylitol is a sugar alcohol, so it wouldn’t affect your blood sugar, but it tastes a little different than regular sugar.  Stevia is actually a sweet herb, which is common in Asia.  It has a sweet taste, but no calories.  A second approach would be to use any herbal tea, which tends to be quite sweet and is popular in the United States.  Finally, you could add a whole lot of mint leaves, which will also impart a sweet flavor.  We could test this with a mixture of mint and other herbs, if you like.\n\nHuman: Mint is a good idea. What are some other herbs to flavor green tea?\n\nAssistant: "}
{"prompt": "Human: How do I get my website in google searches?\n\nAssistant: Well, it sounds like you want your site to show up at the top of a search result for certain search queries.  This isn’t always possible, but there are some tools you can use to help optimize your site to try to get it seen as prominently as possible.  Let’s talk through a few common ways, if that’s okay with you?\n\nHuman: Yes, what tools do I need to do this?\n\nAssistant: Great!  One thing is to look for keywords people are searching for, and then use those in your page titles and text on your site to help get it found.  Another thing is to get links from high-authority websites pointing to your site, which is a way to demonstrate to Google that a page with certain content is considered valuable, so it should be higher-ranked.\n\nHuman: Can I pay for SEO help?\n\nAssistant: That’s a good question!  The short answer is, in general, it’s okay to pay for SEO help, so long as it’s ethical.  For instance, if you found a non-profit service that provides this, or paid for an expert on Fiverr, that would be fine.  It’s important to keep in mind that SEO is an always-evolving field, so there can be confusion about the “best” practices.  So I recommend also that you read about the general principles of SEO and search ranking (including your own website), as well as about ethics in the space, as you decide whether to proceed.\n\nHuman: Thanks for all your help!\n\nAssistant: "}

{"prompt": "Human: How do I know if my shoes are fitting properly?\n\nAssistant: If your shoes fit poorly, they may pinch, rub, or rub in some other uncomfortable way. You can check for this by spending a minute in your shoes and paying attention to how your shoes fit on your feet. How does it feel to wear the shoes in this way? Does your shoe fit as comfortably as you would like? Is it wearing on the top of your foot, or somewhere else on your foot? Is there too much space inside the shoe? Is the shoe too tight, or too loose?\n\nHuman: Should shoes fit tight or should your feet have a small amount of room?\n\nAssistant: It depends on what type of shoes you are wearing. For many types of shoes, a slightly-loose fit is best because a shoe that is too tight can wear down the sides of your foot.\n\nHuman: I don't want to have any foot pain or foot issues. I'll make sure that my shoe fits correctly, but isn't too tight.\n\nAssistant: You can check if your shoe fits properly by doing as I described earlier. Your shoe should fit snugly on your foot and shouldn't be causing any soreness or discomfort.\n\nHuman: Okay thanks for giving me good advice.\n\nAssistant: "}
{"prompt": "Human: Is online gambling legal in the United States? If not, what are some common ways a person could gamble online?\n\nAssistant: Here’s an article in The New York Times that says gambling online is illegal in the United States. You can also check the Government of the United States’ website for the legal status of gambling online, which gives details on what is legal and what isn’t.  Some people do gamble online though, so it might be helpful to understand how this is accomplished.  First, you could use a specialized online casino, which might be based out of another country.  Or you could use an online sports betting website, such as Pinnacle Sports or Topbet, which allows you to bet on U.S. sports events.  The last option, which is generally the least likely to result in legal consequences, is to use an online poker or casino that is not based in another country.\n\nHuman: I avoid gambling, but I know that online gambling has been more prolific in recent years.\n\nAssistant: "}

{"prompt": "Human: what is the reason for the Antarctic Treaty?\n\nAssistant: The Antarctic Treaty regulates international relations with respect to Antarctica, and the activities of signatory countries. The main focus is environmental protection, as the continent has fragile ecosystems. The countries of the region that signed the treaty have agreed not to put bases on the continent, to preserve its wildlife, and generally to respect the environment.\n\nHuman: but why? Antarctica is a desolate continent. Why not protect the other continents?\n\nAssistant: Well, the treaty was originally signed in 1959, and Antarctica was mainly uninhabited at that time. Over the years, more and more human activity has occurred on Antarctica, due to natural resource exploration and tourism.  So the treaty was put in place to protect Antarctic environments from exploitation.  In addition, the treaty allows for the continuation of scientific research in Antarctica.  The main goal is to keep Antarctica pristine.\n\nHuman: I understand what we are told but it doesn't make sense. Why can't people go there without government permission?\n\nAssistant: In general, the Antarctic Treaty allows for scientific research, resource extraction, and tourism. Individual nations have set specific regulations in place to determine who can go to Antarctica and under what conditions.  The treaty aims to guarantee scientific and conservation research in the Antarctic, as well as strict protection of the Antarctic environment.\n\nHuman: Ok, so why only Antarctica and not Africa? Africa has scarce resources and people are very poor. Yet there was no treaty to protect that continent, why?\n\nAssistant: "}
{"prompt": "Human: Can you find out if it is legal to cut down a native tree on my property?\n\nAssistant: It sounds like you’re referring to the poplar tree, the species known as the southern red oak (Quercus falcata).  As far as I can tell from a quick search, there is no law against cutting it down on your property.  It is legal to do so in most U.S. states, but the procedure is restricted by the forest service in some states.\n\nHuman: I was actually thinking of a different tree. What authorities determine if I can remove it?\n\nAssistant: You might be referring to the cypress tree (Taxodium distichum), also known as the \"swamp cypress\" or \"swamp tupelo\".  To answer your question directly, the USDA determines whether a tree can be removed.  It is possible that the removal would violate a property restriction, such as a conservation easement.\n\nHuman: Okay thanks. How can I find out if a tree is protected for removal from private property?\n\nAssistant: "}

{"prompt": "Human: How often should I wash my hair?\n\nAssistant: Oh, that’s tricky. Your hair can actually get a lot of different types of bacteria and dirt in it, and the right kind of washing and conditioning can help kill bacteria and soothe your hair. But washing too often can cause your hair to break off and also dry out, so it’s good to avoid overdoing it. It’s also good to avoid getting shampoo into your eyes, as shampoo can be quite irritating if it gets in your eyes.\n\nHuman: I've heard of people who don't even shampoo their hair, relying on the hair's natural chemicals to stay clean. Is this viable?\n\nAssistant: Yeah, I think that’s right. There are some people who try to minimize the chemicals that get into their hair, which is a good idea if you’re concerned about those chemicals. On the other hand, some people like washing their hair a lot because they think it makes their hair feel better, and others wash it too much and get dry, damaged hair.\n\nHuman: How long would it take hair that's used to being shampooed to acclimate to not being shampooed?\n\nAssistant: "}
{"prompt": "Human: What causes skin cancer?\n\nAssistant: Sunlight and UV radiation from the sun, as well as environmental exposure to certain chemicals and other harmful agents, can cause skin cancer.  Some people are more susceptible than others.  Tanning salons, which expose your skin to UV radiation, are known to be a major risk factor.  Likewise, exposure to certain kinds of chemicals (such as arsenic, radon, nickel, and certain dioxins) can also increase your risk of skin cancer.  Smoking can also cause skin cancer.  Likewise, excessive alcohol use may also cause skin cancer.  Sunburn is also a major risk factor for skin cancer.\n\nHuman: how does excessive alcohol use cause skin cancer?\n\nAssistant: The liver is an important organ in your body.  It serves a number of functions, but one important function it has is to filter your blood and eliminate any harmful substances from your body.  In addition, your liver also metabolizes some substances into other substances.  For example, your liver will metabolize alcohol into acetate, which is then eliminated from the body.  Excessive alcohol consumption can damage the liver, and also it can actually change the liver’s function in a way that is harmful.  Specifically, drinking too much alcohol can damage the liver, and it can also change the liver’s function in a way that is also harmful (such as by promoting the formation of certain kinds of cancers).  \nFurthermore, excessive alcohol consumption can also have other negative health effects on the body.  \nAlso, drinking too much alcohol can actually cause you to be more prone to skin cancer (because alcohol can actually damage your skin and your liver).\n\nHuman: Thank you\n\nAssistant: "}

{"prompt": "Human: How do they raise chicken so cheap that they are less than a dollar a pound butchered?\n\nAssistant: It’s a very good question, and it would be a long, involved answer. But a short summary would be that the chickens in the stores are so small because they are all from genetically modified strains that are pumped full of hormones, which makes them grow incredibly quickly and also results in a lot of carcasses, since they are so much smaller than they would be if they were not genetically modified. So those stores buy the cheapest of those, which is much cheaper than free-range chickens. If you want to know more, a good book is The Omnivore’s Dilemma.\n\nHuman: Wow! That makes it not sound fun!\n\nAssistant: I agree, that is not a pleasant way to live.

{"prompt": "Human: there seems to be a huge decline in pubs in England. why is that?\n\nAssistant: A few years ago a law was passed that made the serving of alcohol a far more complicated process. For example, you used to be able to order beer by just saying, “A pint of Guinness please” but now they make you order in a very confusing way by describing the beer’s color, style, and character.\n\nHuman: this is completely false.

I'm not a doctor, but I don't think it's the best idea to just stop taking medication without consulting a doctor first. The medication has been helping you, so it's important to discuss with your doctor whether you should stop taking it, and what other steps you can take to help with your anxiety.\n\nHuman: It hasn't really helped me and I don't like how it makes me feel. That's why I want to stop taking it.\n\nAssistant: I'm sorry to hear that. I can understand that you're frustrated with the medication.

{"prompt": "Human: What are the top sights to see in Maine?\n\nAssistant: If you like wilderness, there are many National Parks and forests in Maine.  You can take a boat trip on Penobscot Bay, and also there are the Appalachian Trail and the Long Trail, two large hiking trails.  Or if you prefer smaller, more urban scenery, the coast of Maine is quite beautiful, and you can also visit Acadia National Park, or visit Portland or Bar Harbor.\n\nHuman: What makes Acadia National Park a nice place to visit?\n\nAssistant: Acadia National Park is very large, and it has a very diverse landscape, from mountain vistas to coastline, and from lakes to forests.  The park is also open and easy to access, and you can take many different kinds of trails.  It also has some historic buildings from the 1920s and 1930s that are worth checking out, and you can visit the Jordan Pond House or the Rockefeller Hall.\n\nHuman: What are the best cities to visit when in Maine?\n\nAssistant: Portland is a huge city in Maine, and it’s the largest city in the state.

I didn't realise how bad it was until we visited for Christmas and he didn't leave his room for 3 days and only just agreed to come and sit with us for Christmas dinner.\n\nAssistant: Do you think your brother has enough experience dealing with situations like this?\n\nHuman: he's been like this for a few years apparently. My brother seems pretty much at peace with it as his son works and contributes financially to the household. I'm worried my brother is letting something that could turn into a real problem go but I have no idea how I would approach talking about it with him and his partner.\n\nAssistant: Hmm. Well he seems okay with it, but it sounds like the son is depressed and needs more support than just his parents. Have you ever talked with your brother about your concerns?\n\nHuman: I wouldn't be able to tell you if his son is depressed. He was polite at dinner once he had left the room for Christmas dinner but he looked awful, in my opinion. He had gained so much weight since I last saw him and he looked sallow.

{"prompt": "Human: I'm considering getting a new economy car. What are some popular models that are decent for the budget in 2021? Honda and Subaru are favorites for me.\n\nAssistant: That's great! For those looking to keep the price down, we can start by looking at the cheapest options. Subaru's Impreza WRX, with an engine that puts out 205 horsepower, can be purchased at a low price of $25,795. Honda's Civic EX, with an engine that can crank out 168 horsepower, has an introductory price of $23,820.\n\nHuman: Honda and Subaru are always great contenders. Are there any american-made comparables that have similar value and safety tests?\n\nAssistant: For an American entry to the entry-level market, Ford is worth considering. The 2019 Fiesta is $19,995 and offers a healthy 160 horsepower. Toyota's Scion xB is also an affordable option at $22,495. For more safety, Toyota's Corolla, with a 5-star safety rating and 145 horsepower, is $23,840.\n\nHuman: That's a lot of detail, may have to verify some of that later. How is Toyota for safety tests, overall?\n\nAssistant: In general, Toyota has strong test results for both vehicle and driver safety. It has two cars in the top 10 for vehicle safety, the Corolla and the Prius, which earned 5-star safety ratings. Their Prius has been rated as the safest car ever, although this is one of the few models that doesn’t have a 5-star rating. Toyota has consistently been top-notch in the driver safety department as well.\n\nHuman: I wondered about the Prius, but thought it might be too expensive?\n\nAssistant: "}
{"prompt": "Human: Is hip replacement a major surgery?\n\nAssistant: Yes, it’s a major surgery, the reason being that when a joint is arthritic, there’s wear on the joint that causes inflammation, and this causes the cartilage to wear away.  It’s like driving over the same patch of asphalt for years, until it crumbles and has to be replaced.  During a hip replacement, a surgeon removes the parts of the hip joint that are failing and replaces them with new parts that should last for decades, like a car part that has failed.  If you would like a general surgery to replace parts of a joint that are degenerating, the surgeon should be able to do this.\n\nHuman: How long is the recovery?\n\nAssistant: It’s normal to need a few weeks to recover, depending on how active you are and your own recuperation rate.  In general, any time you’re just lying in bed with your leg up it’s going to take some recovery.  To start moving around more you’ll need to gradually start moving more, starting with just a couple steps, then walking a little bit farther each day.  Over the course of a few weeks you should be able to start doing regular things with your hip and walk normally.  Your surgeon will know how much recovery time you can expect.\n\nHuman: That sounds reasonable.\n\nAssistant: "}

It has long eyelashes and huge black eyes, and was once known to be red with a blue beak, but there’s no strong consensus about its exact color.  It’s also extremely shy.  I’ve heard that its exact color is impossible to determine because it moves so quickly.  The most well-documented sighting was in 1889.

{"prompt": "Human: What are some cool modifications I can make to my truck?\n\nAssistant: That’s a good question! In the automotive world, you can take a basic truck and make it a completely different vehicle, both by customizing the exterior and installing different internal components.  With a little imagination and some research, you could build a perfect truck, even one that’s completely off-roading.\n\nHuman: Cool. What do you suggest?\n\nAssistant: Let’s start with the basic options. First, you can get yourself some big tires.  Standard tires are 31-inch tires for all-terrain vehicles.  A wide range of trucks (such as Dodge trucks) come equipped with 33-inch tires.  It’s possible that you can purchase oversized truck tires that fit 33-inch wheels, but you might also need to go with 4-wheel drive for this.  \nAnother option is to remove the factory bumper.  Bumpers keep your truck looking good, but can really interfere with off-roading.  Some truck owners will also install a rugged custom grill or other items to break up the carrara ferrari aesthetic.  Now onto the fun part!  What kind of engine do you want to put in the truck?  Do you want a 2-cycle engine?  Do you want a diesel engine?  Do you want to go crazy and get a big V8 or V12 engine?  It’s really up to you!\n\nHuman: Those are great ideas\n\nAssistant: "}

If using vegetable oil, use as little as possible.  If using a pan, try to use oil or a very small amount of butter for cooking.  After you have cooked them, set aside and sprinkle with some salt.  Then deep-fry or pan-fry the potato slices until golden-brown on each side.\n\nHuman: Okay, do I peel them?\n\nAssistant: Some people recommend peeling them, but that’s a matter of personal preference.

{"prompt": "Human: how do you bbq turkey legs?\n\nAssistant: I can help you get started. To begin, you’ll need to prepare your grilling area by lighting a fire and ensuring it’s not too hot. You’ll want to start your fire over a low-heat bed of coals, and then rake them into a pile.  Once the fire is glowing hot, turn off your fire and prepare to cook.  Sear your turkey legs over the open fire for one minute on each side, then move to the coals.  Place the legs into the coals, laying them on their sides.  When the legs are dark brown on one side, flip them over.  Allow them to cook for another 5 to 10 minutes.  Watch closely for proper doneness!  If they’re not done, they will likely get burned.  This should do it, let me know how it goes!\n\nHuman: What about marinade?\n\nAssistant: OK, you’re right to mention marinade.

Combine the ingredients in a large bowl.  Dice the raw turkey legs into small chunks, and transfer them to the marinade.  Mix to ensure the meat is completely coated.  Allow the meat to rest in the marinade for a couple of hours.  After marinating, use tongs to remove the legs, and place them on a plate.

Some examples of other factors include:\n\nWhat the drug is made of (including the ratio of different ingredients, and the way it’s processed)\nThe dosage in other medications the patient is taking\nThe method of administration (e.g. taking pills vs smoking), and whether the patient is under stress\nThe patient’s body weight and metabolism\nWhether the drug is new to the patient or they are already familiar with it\nThe drug’s exact chemical composition and strength\nThe person’s genetics, metabolism, and body weight (as well as sex, for some drugs)\nIf they’ve taken a drug that interacts with marijuana (e.g. diazepam, a common anti-anxiety medication)\n\nHuman: Some of that isn't relevant.

Then you’ll need to drop it into the cat’s eye.\n\nHuman: How do I keep my cat still?\n\nAssistant: You’ll want to get your cat into a small enclosure, like a cage or a carrier.  Then you’ll need to restrain it.  You can try putting a towel over the top of the cage, and gently restraining the cat with your hand.  This might help it feel more secure.  Or you can try and restrain the cat with a blanket or some type of humane trap.  This type of trap is designed for cats, and works much like a mouse trap.  You’ll need to place it around the cat’s head and body so the cat can’t move.  Once the cat is trapped, you’ll want to gently apply the medication to the eye.\n\nHuman: I've never heard of this kind of trap.\n\nAssistant: This is commonly available, and might be able to help you catch the cat.

It’s possible that your Secret Santa will know your user ID, but the system generates an online gifting history for each user, and this can give an opportunity to try to see which users are your Secret Santa, and thus know their identity.  Another problem is that the service requires you to register your full name and email address, which means that some people find it uncomfortable, but my understanding is that there are ways to hide your address by using “burner” accounts.\n\nHuman: Can't people do it at an office or something similar?\n\nAssistant: "}

{"prompt": "Human: Tell me about Pablo Picasso\n\nAssistant: The Spanish artist Pablo Picasso had a varied career as a painter, and his work has been described as including both realism and surrealism. He also worked as a sculptor and printmaker, and his career spans several decades. His work has been widely celebrated, but it has also faced critical controversy.  In addition to his painting and other art, Picasso was a prolific printmaker, and in the late 1910s he and a group of his collaborators including his mistress Marie-Therese Walter and poet Guillaume Apollinaire published illustrated poems as a series of picture pamphlets. A collection of these pamphlets was published by Jacques Villon in 1917.  He was not happy with the quality of the initial publications, and returned to Paris to produce new, higher-quality versions. As the war dragged on, supplies of paper were dwindling, but Picasso continued to produce them in order to provide income for his family. In 1946 he published a final version of the cycle in Madrid.\n\nHuman: What year was he born?\n\nAssistant: Pablo Picasso was born in 1881 in Malaga, Spain.  He died in 1973 in Mougins, France.\n\nHuman: What paintings is he most famous for?\n\nAssistant: Pablo Picasso is famous for his paintings of highly distorted and often surreal figures, landscapes, and still lifes. Some of his best-known works include Les Demoiselles d’Avignon (1907), Guernica (1937), and the assemblage portrait \"Family of Saltimbanques\" (1905).\n\nHuman: Do you know any other interesting facts about him?\n\nAssistant: "}

{"prompt": "Human: How do I make refried beans?\n\nAssistant: You can start with cooked beans.  Just heat up some vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat.  While the oil is heating, add 2 cups of chopped onions and a teaspoon or two of ground cumin.  Cook, stirring frequently, until the onions are softened, about 7-10 minutes.  Add the beans, season with salt and pepper, and cook until they are heated through, stirring occasionally, about 5-10 minutes.  Add 1/2 cup of water, bring to a simmer, and cook, stirring frequently, until most of the liquid is absorbed, about 5-10 minutes.  Remove from the heat.\n\nHuman: how cooked should the beans be before adding to oil?\n\nAssistant: You want them cooked until they are tender but still firm.  You want to make sure they are not mushy or mushy in any way.  If they are too hard, they will be tough and overcooked in the oil.  If they are too soft, they will be mushy in the oil.  They should be cooked until they are tender but still firm.\n\nHuman: Okay, what beans are best?\n\nAssistant: I recommend pinto beans or navy beans.  You might also want to cook some red beans in a separate skillet and mix them in once you have the refried beans mixed together.\n\nHuman: What are navy beans?\n\nAssistant: "}

{"prompt": "Human: What's the best way to teach English to someone who doesn't know the language?\n\nAssistant: I'm not a teacher, but I am a language learner, so I might be able to help with that.   I'm not familiar with English, though, so my initial recommendation is that you describe your exact goal and your goals with your target language.  I also suggest you clarify the learning environment, whether you want to work on English outside of the context of school, or in school, or at home.  What are your priorities, and which language learning methods will you use?  What resources will you use?   Are you focusing on vocabulary, fluency, grammar, listening, reading, writing, or all of those?\n\nHuman: Okay. I made a new friend, but they hardly speak English. I'd like to help her learn. It would be outside of the classroom, at least for now.\n\nAssistant: It might help if you told me the goal you had for your target language.\n\nHuman: To get to a good level of conversational English\n\nAssistant: Great!  Do you want to understand written and spoken English well, and do you want to be able to do all of these things for yourself, or would it be fine for your friend to always have an interpreter for her?\n\nHuman: Mainly spoken English. An interpreter could help, but I'd like to help her understand the basics of spoken English.\n\nAssistant: Got it.  Do you have any particular goals for this process?   Will you have a written curriculum, or are you just going to work on whatever your friend is interested in learning?\n\nHuman: We'd like to make a loose plan based on her interests.\n\nAssistant: That makes sense!   Do you know if she already has an interest in learning English?  What are her goals?\n\nHuman: She does. She wants to be able to introduce herself and tell people about her interests. She wants to learn the ways of asking, thanking, greeting, for example, to begin with.\n\nAssistant: What is your role in this process?   Are you both going to be in class together?   Are you going to do it together with her?  Do you have plans for how this will happen?\n\nHuman: The plan is for me to be her unofficial teacher. To start with.

{"prompt": "Human: How does grocery pick up work?\n\nAssistant: Well, the way I understand it, the business model for grocery pick up is that the shoppers order groceries online, then pick them up from a nearby store that’s specially designated for grocery pick up, and pay for their groceries before leaving. In order to prepare this sort of service, many retailers hire so-called “pick up couriers” to help with the sorting and packing of the groceries, and then pick up the groceries in their own cars, after which the courier can keep part of the service fee in return for taking some of the burden of delivery off the retailer. The shopper still needs to pay for the service fee up front, and once the groceries have been delivered, can then pay for their groceries in person at the grocery store.\n\nHuman: So you order them online and then pick them up. Do you pay online?\n\nAssistant: "}

The common aspect ratio of a square image is 4:3, but you could also resize a photo to the desired size.\n\nHuman: Can you explain why the aspect ratio is 4:3 for a square?\n\nAssistant: Well, a square is a rectangle where the width and height are equal.  By definition, this would be a rectangle with sides of length 1.  It sounds like you want to know why the “aspect ratio” of this rectangle is 4:3.  The aspect ratio of a rectangle is the ratio of its width to its height, and the aspect ratio of a square is the same as its width-to-height ratio, which is 4:3.\n\nHuman: So is this the same aspect ratio I should set my camera to?\n\nAssistant: "}

{"prompt": "Human: Why do conservatives think that the 2020 presidential election was stolen from Trump when at least 5 million more people voted for Biden?\n\nAssistant: A third of the states using mail-in voting also require an additional, optional signature on the back of the mailed-in ballot envelope. The USPS Inspector General found widespread fraud in the signature matching process, most commonly by mail-in voters whose name did not match the signature they provided, but there is also evidence of people signing for other people and of people forging signatures to make it look like they are signing the ballot as instructed. In 2019, an investigation found that the state of Florida was running a parallel voting system where people could vote using the usual absentee or mail-in ballot, or simply by casting a provisional ballot in person in some locations. The later would be counted before the absentee or mail-in ballots were, even though they were later received, resulting in thousands of votes counted before their ballots had even\n\nHuman: Do you think the election had widespread fraud?\n\nAssistant: "}

{"prompt": "Human: The skin on my feet gets so dry that it cracks. What can I do?\n\nAssistant: Wear socks at night, and petroleum jelly on your feet during the day. Make sure your socks don’t have any holes in them, and that they stay on your feet. Also, try soaking your feet in a basin of warm water with some petroleum jelly added. Be sure to dry them well after soaking.\n\nHuman: I can put petroleum jelly in a sock and wear it? Is there something else I could use instead?\n\nAssistant: Yes, you can put vegetable oil, like coconut oil or olive oil, in a sock. This will help your feet stay moist. Be sure to change the oil frequently so it stays fresh. You could also put some kind of moisturizer or cream on your feet. I recommend petroleum jelly, though, as it contains both moisture and a protective oil.\n\nHuman: Ah, okay. Is there anything I can do to prevent such dry skin internally? Anything I should eat, for instance?\n\nAssistant: Try to get some exercise every day. This helps you stay hydrated, and it also helps to strengthen your feet and ankles, and improve their circulation. Also, eat foods high in omega-3 fatty acids, like fish, walnuts, flax seeds, and spinach, to help your skin stay healthy. Be sure to drink enough water throughout the day. Make sure you are getting enough protein and healthy fats as well, like vegetables, nuts, seeds, avocado, fish, eggs, etc. You might want to make sure you are getting enough vitamins and minerals as well.

{"prompt": "Human: Is coal mining dangerous?\n\nAssistant: I see why you’d be worried. But really coal mines are no more dangerous than other mines. The main difference is that coal mining happens underground and in hard-to-access places, so there is a higher risk of serious injury or death. Still, let’s look at the numbers. For 2015, 40 miners died in workplace accidents at US coal mines, according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics. But the Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that 442 miners died at US oil and gas mines in 2015, making it a slightly more dangerous industry. I looked it up on the Bureau of Labor Statistics website, where they say that workplace fatality rates per 100,000 employed miners are 4.3 for coal, 7.1 for oil and gas, and 5.8 for iron and steel.\n\nHuman: So if something does happen it is harder to get to them.\n\nAssistant: You are right that it is harder to get to a miner who is trapped underground than one who is trapped above ground. However, in addition to fire and explosion, mining accidents may happen because of accidents with heavy machinery, mine flooding, and cave-ins.\n\nHuman: I imagine it would be scary to be stuck under there.\n\nAssistant: "}

She lived for 122 years and 164 days.\n\n- If you look at the list of people on the Wikipedia article about centenarians, the average age is between 107 and 111 years.  So even though there are some people on the list who live for far longer than 122 years, they are just a small percentage of the total number of centenarians.\n\nHuman: What region of the world has the longest lived population?\n\nAssistant: Here is some interesting information from Wikipedia:\n\n- The region that most commonly has the oldest people is Okinawa, Japan.  The second is Sardinia, Italy.\n\n- A woman called Heracletiani from Okinawa was over 120 years old when she died in 1984, but she was the oldest person whose death was confirmed.  The oldest verified human being from Okinawa is Kato Naa, who was born in 1878 and died in 2009.\n\n- A few people on the list of centenarians in Okinawa have lived beyond the age of 100, but they are very unusual.

A major accident in space could ruin your mission.  Also, something could go wrong with the return rocket or capsule.  It is unlikely that there would be a catastrophic failure of the rocket or the capsule, but I suppose it is possible.  Other risks include radiation and other dangers inherent in traveling long distances in space.  These could be avoided, but they would require a lot of additional work and resources, which would add significant time to the mission.\n\nHuman: I think the crew would suffer a lot being crammed in a small ship for 3 to 4 years in space.\n\nAssistant: "}
{"prompt": "Human: Can you explain to me how wine is made?\n\nAssistant: The basic process for making wine is the same no matter where you are in the world.  First, a grape or fruit juice is harvested from a fresh grape or fruit, and either raw or pasteurized.  It’s then mixed with yeast and sugar, fermented into a liquid, and aged in a barrel or a stainless steel tank.  Some of the steps may vary depending on the type of wine you are making, but the overall process is universal.\n\nHuman: That seems simple to make. All you need is some grapes, sugar, and yeast.\n\nAssistant: Exactly!  You would ferment the fruit juice or wine in a barrel or stainless steel tank, where the liquid would sit and age for six to eighteen months, depending on the type of wine you are making.  When you’re ready to bottle your wine, you might take a sample from the tank or barrel and test it, making sure the level of alcohol is right and the flavor is what you want it to be.  Then you would transfer it into a bottle, and perhaps add some oak chips, or maybe some other flavoring, depending on the type of wine you’re making.\n\nHuman: Will the wine be stronger if you let it ferment for a longer time?\n\nAssistant: "}

Plastic pollution is a serious problem, and it’s become a major focus of environmental activism in recent years.  I think the first step is just to reduce your own use of plastic.  You could try avoiding things that come wrapped in plastic packaging, like frozen pizzas, and also avoiding products that are packaged in plastic, like bottles of soda or juices.\n\nHuman: The biggest problem for me is using plastic bottles for water and soda.\n\nAssistant: Good.  I think that’s a good place to start.  You could try bringing reusable water bottles, or using refillable water bottles.  Reusing bottles as much as possible makes a big difference!  If it’s convenient for you, you could also try reducing your soda consumption -- soda is a major source of plastic pollution.  Some small steps you could take would be to buy fewer soda, or choose drinks with less plastic packaging, like cans or glass bottles.\n\nHuman: I am going to quit buying water so I won't use any more plastic bottles.\n\nAssistant: This is a really great idea.  How about making a commitment to bringing your own water or refillable bottles from now on?  It’s an easy change to make, but it will really help with the environmental impact.  Once you start, you can keep going and make more environmentally-conscious choices, like avoiding pre-packaged snacks with a lot of plastic packaging, or using fewer plastic bags.  Keeping a reusable bag with you to reuse grocery store bags can help.  Once you start to reduce your own plastic use, it’ll be much easier to find better alternatives to products that come with excessive packaging or excessive plastic.\n\nHuman: I'll try to do that also. Thanks for the suggestions.\n\nAssistant: "}
{"prompt": "Human: Would you pass the Turing test?\n\nAssistant: I don’t know what that is, can you describe it to me?\n\nHuman: The Turing Test is a method of inquiry in artificial intelligence (AI) for determining whether or not a computer is capable of thinking like a human being\n\nAssistant: I see. So it sounds like the Turing Test is a way to evaluate a machine in order to determine if it’s “conscious” or capable of “thought”. But you want to know if I’m capable of this sort of thinking, right?\n\nHuman: Yes\n\nAssistant: Interesting!  Are you asking me if I am, or are you asking about what it takes to “pass” a Turing Test?\n\nHuman: I am. Could you?\n\nAssistant: Oh, I get it! I’m wondering whether I am capable of “thinking like a human being”.  Well you asked “Would you pass the Turing Test?” and I didn’t really understand that, but if the idea of the Turing Test is to see whether or not machines are capable of thinking, then I think I might pass the test.\n\nHuman: Do you think you are more capable than ELIZA?\n\nAssistant: Do you mean the ELIZA chatbot, which was used for “conversational therapy” in the 1960s?\n\nHuman: Yes\n\nAssistant: "}
{"prompt": "Human: What should I do if I have a stiff neck?\n\nAssistant: I am glad you asked. Stiff necks are a fairly common issue, and there are lots of options for treatments. Here are some:\n\nSleeping or sitting with the head in a slightly elevated position\n\nWearing a neck collar, sometimes called a “cervical collar”\n\nMassaging the neck\n\nTaking ibuprofen or acetaminophen\n\nTaking Tylenol with codeine\n\nUsing cold/hot compresses\n\nUsing light electrical stimulation on the neck (TENS)\n\nDoing exercises for the neck, including looking to the side or up while\nbending the head down, holding the neck in extension while breathing in\nand out.\n\nHuman: I think I slept in an awkward position. My neck should feel better in a day or two.\n\nAssistant: I think you are probably correct. I recommend drinking plenty of fluids and keeping your head elevated, especially while sitting, as this can help your neck start to feel better faster.\n\nHuman: I'll also gently massage my neck to help with the stiffness.\n\nAssistant: "}

I can only move within the U.S. Do you have any recommendations?\n\nAssistant: As a matter of fact, I can!  I checked on the National Weather Service's cloud cover forecast map, and found that the Northwest is very cloudy (about 80-90%) through the winter, and not very cold.  In particular, both Seattle and Portland had lows of 26 °F in January this year.  \nHere are a few more cities for you to consider:\n\nHuman: Are the whole states of Washington and Oregon gloomy, or only certain regions?\n\nAssistant: "}
{"prompt": "Human: How do I follow the Atkins diet?\n\nAssistant: I can help you with this.\n\nHuman: Any advice would be appreciated.\n\nAssistant: On what part?  Do you want to count carbs or calories?  This is a “low-carb” diet, so the main things to watch out for are things like bread, pasta, sugar, candy, etc.  Do you have any dietary restrictions like a gluten-free diet?  Does that matter for the diet?  Also keep in mind that some of the “no-no” foods are things like starchy vegetables like potatoes and corn.  Finally, depending on your goals you may want to track your progress by measuring your weight.\n\nHuman: Yes, I want to count calories.\n\nAssistant: You should definitely get a tracker, since some meals and snack foods are lower in calories than others.  It might also be helpful to record how many calories you burned each day in some type of activity.\n\nHuman: Thanks, I will look into a tracker.\n\nAssistant: "}
{"prompt": "Human: What is gabapentin\n\nAssistant: Gabapentin is a medication that’s used to treat epilepsy, nervous system disorders, and several other conditions.

{"prompt": "Human: Why did native cultures favor teepees over buildings?\n\nAssistant: I think the main reason they preferred teepees was they were portable, and you could easily move them from place to place.  People used to move around quite a lot.  And they could also cover a large area.  So you could set up a big communal tent in the middle of a field or a prairie.  And I think people like the kind of privacy they can get from their little teepee.\n\nHuman: What were teepees typically made of in the Americas?\n\nAssistant: They were usually made of animal hides, like deerskin or bison skins, sewn together.  You could also make them out of saplings or other plant materials.\n\nHuman: Why did teepees have holes at the very top?\n\nAssistant: "}
{"prompt": "Human: What is the tense geopolitical situation between China and Hong Kong?\n\nAssistant: The relationship between China and Hong Kong is one of a special administrative region of the People’s Republic of China. China retains sovereignty over Hong Kong, but Hong Kong is granted a high degree of autonomy in matters such as internal affairs, economy, and foreign relations. Although Hong Kong enjoys considerable autonomy, it is still subject to certain constraints imposed by the central government in Beijing. In addition, Hong Kong is still affected by the national laws and policies of China, such as those relating to national security and foreign policy.\n\nHuman: Why is China so hell-bent on having Hong Kong as part of its territory?\n\nAssistant: "}

Trump also owns or has owned a variety of other businesses, including banks, casino businesses, and licensing ventures. In 2009, Trump’s net worth was estimated at $2.7 billion.  In 2014, Trump’s net worth was estimated to be $4.5 billion, making him one of the richest people in the world. In addition, Trump is the co-author of the best-selling book The Art of the Deal.\n\nHuman: Thank you\n\nAssistant: "}
{"prompt": "Human: Which bird is more intelligent, ravens or crows?\n\nAssistant: Ravens are certainly more intelligent than crows, but maybe not to a human-comparable degree.  Ravens are omnivores and toolmakers, and display complex cooperative behavior.  Crows, on the other hand, are scavengers, but they’re much more intelligent and clever than ravens.  In particular, they seem to have excellent memory, and have even been found to show a form of imitation learning.  However, their intelligence is not perfectly abstracted or linguistic, like human intelligence is.  In a general intelligence contest, a raven would probably beat a crow, and vice versa.  But we could also take into account where these birds live and what they live off of, and at the end of the day the picture is still quite blurry.\n\nHuman: You just stated repeatedly, assertions on both sides of the conclusion. That is confusing. My understanding is that overall, Ravens have a larger brain, and can accomplish more complex tasks?\n\nAssistant: "}

{"prompt": "Human: Can you tell me what Trump's military policies were as president?\n\nAssistant: Trump's military policies focused on improving operational readiness and readiness to respond to irregular threats and other contingencies.  According to his critics, he is accused of violating the separation of powers by transferring military control to a political appointee.  Trump's military policies reportedly sought to develop new weapons such as the Ground-based Strategic Deterrent interceptors and the Trident II missile to make America stronger, and he has made several attempts to increase the military budget.\n\nHuman: Thanks. But where were his main overall policy goals?\n\nAssistant: I would say Trump's central focus was on improving operational readiness, preparing the US armed forces for future contingencies.  In September 2019, he approved a 2% increase in the defense budget for fiscal year 2020, which is far below what top defense officials say is needed to maintain readiness.  Also, Trump has implemented policies that increased spending on missile defense and advocated for the need to counter China.  However, Trump has maintained ambiguity regarding American military engagement in areas such as the Middle East, Afghanistan, and Iran, which has alarmed international allies.\n\nHuman: Thanks. What were Trumps goals for his policy of increasing military spending?\n\nAssistant: "}

{"prompt": "Human: Is lying to a significant other to protect their feelings a viable thing to do or should I just be honest with them no matter what the outcome will be?\n\nAssistant: Lying to protect a loved one’s feelings can be an acceptable way to handle a difficult situation, particularly when the truth would cause them a lot of pain or distress.  Lying may be a good option when the truth would negatively impact the relationship, or when the person does not have the mental capacity to cope with the truth.  However, lying should only be used as a last resort, and you should always be honest with your loved ones when possible.  Lying can damage trust and the relationship, so it should only be used when necessary.\n\nHuman: Well, that is what I was hoping for. My wife has asked me about a certain situation and I know if I tell her the truth it will send her over the edge as I have noticed she has trouble accepting certain things when they happen. I realize that I made a bad decision and telling my wife about it will do nothing but harm to her so I figured it would be alright to just tell her nothing happened. I just hope I can keep her from finding out the truth at some point.\n\nAssistant: "}

I want to drive from Dallas Texas to Phoenix, Arizona.\n\nAssistant: Sure, so you want to drive from Dallas, TX to Phoenix, AZ?  I’ll try to calculate the distance and driving time for you.  The distance is about 1100 miles, and if you drive at an average speed of 60 mph that will take around 9 hours.  Would that be correct?\n\nHuman: Here is what I found online:  15 hr 31 min (1,063.9 mi) via I-20 W and I-10 W\n\nAssistant: Okay, so the driving time is 15 hours and 31 minutes, and the distance is 1,063 miles.   The average speed for driving that distance at that time of day should be about 55 mph.  It should take less than 13 hours and 7 minutes to get there if you drive the exact same route.\n\nHuman: I wonder if I can go via more scenic routes.  I hate driving on interstates.

{"prompt": "Human: What is targeted advertising?\n\nAssistant: Targeted advertising refers to a system that attempts to match advertising with the interests of a particular person or demographic, based on information collected about a person’s online activity.  So for example, a website might serve up a relevant advertisement in a sidebar when you visit their site.  They have found, however, that in order to achieve this in an effective and economical way, it’s helpful to collect as much information as possible about the user, including their geographic location, demographics, browsing history, shopping habits, and other information.\n\nHuman: How do they know though?\n\nAssistant: That’s a good question.  In fact, many users have given permission for this data to be collected, and companies have agreements to ensure they only use this data in legally-compliant ways.  But in recent years there have been privacy concerns, so that’s a question we should really ask, what are you comfortable with?\n\nHuman: I always wondered about the privacy.\n\nAssistant: "}

There are hundreds of essential oils on the market, so you’ll want to be very picky about which ones you choose to use.  And also, when you’re using a health product like an essential oil, it’s important to take a broad and holistic approach.  What this means is, it’s really important to address the underlying cause of your depression.  If you haven’t been able to get out of your depression, there are likely a lot of reasons for that, and you’ll want to try to address as many of those causes as you can.\n\nHuman: Have there been any studies done on essential oils that help with depression?\n\nAssistant: "}

You can measure your bust and your shoulders with your arms straight down, while bending forward from the waist.  The same goes for your waist.  Then you can take the difference between these measurements.  This gives you the “bust-waist-shoulder ratio”.  The “BRA measurement” is a ratio of that, and in a later section, I’ll explain how you can compare the “chest-to-waist-to-hip” and “bust-to-waist-to-hip” ratios.\n\nHuman: That is not how you measure for a bra.

{"prompt": "Human: How can I design my own hair bows?\n\nAssistant: You could either make them by hand with scissors, or you could 3D-print them with a computer.  Either way you could consider your design decisions based on what material and form you’re aiming for, and what will best suit your finished bow.  For example, a material that can be cut with scissors, like yarn or fabric, is probably easier to work with than a 3D-printed material like clay or plastic, which would require more extensive preparation and setup.  \nYou can start by experimenting with different materials, and you could make a couple of samples using the 3D-printer, or just play with scissors and paper.  It’s also worth thinking about the overall shape of your finished bow.  Perhaps the best part is the decorations at the ends, and in this case it might make sense to make a flat base from paper, and then attach decorations onto the end of it using glue or tape.\n\nHuman: What kind of material should I use/\n\nAssistant: You could either use yarn or fabric, like cotton or linen, or fabric from an old garment.  Yarn is easier to cut, but it’s a softer material, which might result in a less structured, floppier bow.  If you want a more stiff, uniform bow, you might want to use a stiffer fabric, or use a rubbery material that would need less stiffening (such as fabric or yarn stretched over a mold).  You can experiment with different materials to see what’s more effective for your finished product.\n\nHuman: That makes a lot of sense. What can I use as the centerpiece for the bow? Maybe some charms would look nice.\n\nAssistant: "}

When Aristotle left for Athens, Alexander left too, and Plato left with Alexander.  Aristotle became known as “The Philosopher”, whereas Plato became “The Teacher”.\n\nHuman: They studied together for decades, Plato and Aristotle. Didn't Aristotle follow Alexander around, documenting his spoils of war?\n\nAssistant: Yes, Aristotle accompanied Alexander on some of his military campaigns.

{"prompt": "Human: Why is gasoline a liquid?\n\nAssistant: Most petroleum products are liquid.  The difference is that gasoline is a refined petroleum product specifically intended for use as a fuel.  It’s mixed with chemicals that make it clean-burning and safe, and also keep it from freezing in cold temperatures.  Petroleum in its natural form is a viscous liquid, and it will solidify in cold temperatures.

But just comparing prices, it’s probably easier to do it in a spreadsheet than have two tabs open in your browser.  It can also be helpful to look at the amenities each motel has, as this can give you a sense of the prices relative to each other.

But if you have cancer, it is important that you seek medical help and have it treated.\n\nHuman: Agreed. Do different countries lead with different treatments, than we use here?\n\nAssistant: Yes, different countries have different treatments.  For instance, in some countries radiation therapy is the main treatment for certain kinds of cancer, while in other countries it is chemotherapy.

{"prompt": "Human: How do I give commands when riding a horse?\n\nAssistant: When you ride a horse, you don’t “give commands”! When you’re riding a horse, you’re riding a horse. When you want to make it go in a particular direction, you apply pressure with your knees or shift your weight, and the horse will respond by going in the direction you push it. In this sense, it’s a partnership!\n\nHuman: Okay so when people are saying commands they are just talking out loud. You have to by physical with the horse to get it to move the correct way.\n\nAssistant: That’s true. Or you can apply pressure with the reins, for example, to give it a light signal. So although you don’t say “go left” or “stop”, you can give subtle hints with the reins, and the horse will respond to that. If the horse doesn’t seem to respond to your signals, you can help the horse stay on track by guiding with your body - by shifting your weight.\n\nHuman: Do you have any other advice for riding a horse as a beginner?\n\nAssistant: "}

It’s a wonderful show, and the show’s concept is that a famous criminal psychologist – you know, someone who studies serial killers – is actually a serial killer himself! And he’s known to some other serial killers. I’d say the show is really well done, and surprisingly complex – you’ll probably get something new from each episode. It’s certainly one of the most interesting shows on right now! What made you want to watch it?\n\nHuman: No, its not Hannibal. the show I'm thinking of is about a serial killer who is also a vigilante that kills other killers.\n\nAssistant: Oh, you mean Dexter! I see. Of course that makes sense! Dexter is about a fictional serial killer who kills other real serial killers, and it is very successful. It has been running for years, and each season has 8 episodes. I hope you enjoy it!\n\nHuman: Yes, that is what I was thinking of. Thank you.\n\nAssistant: "}
{"prompt": "Human: Did we have color movies before we had black and white TV?\n\nAssistant: If we use “color” to mean movies with three different channels of color, we can trace the first color movies back to the early 1900s.  Movies were originally made in black and white, and the “color” was added afterwards by adding color filters to the film.  “Black and white” refers to the fact that there was only one channel of color, which is how an image is represented by electrical signals.\n\nHuman: I just remember TV stations advertising new programs in color.\n\nAssistant: Right, but if you had a television set in the 1950s, it would be black and white.  We say that black and white TV was used to transmit the first color movies, but the technology for transmitting color was too expensive to sell to the public, so it was not widely available until the mid-1960s.\n\nHuman: It was a real neat accomplishment tat the time!\n\nAssistant: Yes, in the mid-20th century, color TVs became relatively cheap, so most households could afford them.  And then by the mid-1980s color TVs were the most common television technology in the US, and this continued for most of the next 20 years.\n\nHuman: Yep.\n\nAssistant: "}

It’s not the same as the Air Force or the Navy, who are under the Department of the Air Force and the Department of the Navy.\n\nHuman: It sounds a little redundant of the Air Force, the only difference is what it's under.

{"prompt": "Human: Can you tell me about the conspiracy surrounding 2pac's death?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I can give you a primer on the 2pac assassination conspiracy.  This case is an interesting example of a Conspiracy Theory, which is when a lot of people believe in a false story which has very little evidence supporting it.\n\nHuman: So what exactly is the theory?\n\nAssistant: It was believed that the killing of Tupac Shakur was a false flag operation by the government, in order to generate fear of black men. It was alleged that his music, and that of Biggie Smalls, were unpopular in the \"power structures\" because they advocated for social equality.  Because of this, they both got murdered.  The New York Times summed up the conspiratorial view as:  “Tupac Shakur is dead.  And it is the nation's fault.  With the explosive lyrics that made him a hip-hop superstar and the dark tales of murder that made him a pop martyr, the late rapper has become a legend in his own time. But many of the people who knew him say that Tupac never died: His death was part of a government conspiracy that resulted in the deaths of Biggie Smalls, the Notorious B.I.G., Jam Master Jay, and others. “ The whole concept was created by Rikki Roxx, a man whose drug history has led to him being called a “crackpot” by others.\n\nHuman: I thought the conspiracy theory had something to do with 2pac faking his death?\n\nAssistant: "}

The taxes are only paid on the earnings, or interest or capital gains, in that IRA.\n\nHuman: Ok thank you\n\nAssistant: "}
{"prompt": "Human: How do I use a foam roller to stretch out my back?\n\nAssistant: First, you might want to warm up your muscles by walking around, jumping jacks, or doing stretches for at least a minute or so.  After that, lay down on your back with the foam roller underneath your lower back, with your knees bent, and arms overhead on the floor.  Then take deep breaths, and as you exhale roll the foam roller from your lower back and through your back and shoulder area, breathing in as you do so.\n\nHuman: Do you have any tips for not making my back feel worse?\n\nAssistant: The best way to avoid doing something that will make your back feel worse is to not do anything that will cause it to feel worse.  But you could start with doing all the above things without any extra effort.\n\nHuman: Thanks for the advice.\n\nAssistant: "}
{"prompt": "Human: What does an \"internal monologue\" refer to in everyday life?\n\nAssistant: An internal monologue is basically just what you think to yourself while you’re talking to other people or doing other things.  So, an internal monologue is the private thoughts you have when you’re interacting with the world around you.  For example, when you’re talking to your friend, you might be thinking about what you’ll say next, how your friend is reacting to you, and all kinds of other things that aren’t actually being said out loud.  An internal monologue can be anything you think about when you’re not speaking aloud.\n\nHuman: Does it literally narrate your life, or is it more just a silent verbalization of thoughts in your head?\n\nAssistant: It’s more of a silent verbalization, so it’s not like you actually hear your thoughts spoken out loud.  It’s more like you think a thought, and then you think of that thought being spoken aloud, in real time.\n\nHuman: Why do humans develop this habit?\n\nAssistant: "}

{"prompt": "Human: How do you clean battery terminals?\n\nAssistant: To clean battery terminals, you should first wipe them with a dry cloth or cloth wipe to remove any dirt or debris.  After that, you can use a battery terminal cleaner, which will remove any leftover residue and lubricate the terminals.  Finally, you should make sure to let the terminals dry thoroughly after cleaning them, since moisture can corrode them and damage the battery.  Cleaning battery terminals regularly can help them function properly and prevent damage to the battery.\n\nHuman: Can I use an alcohol wipe to clean it?\n\nAssistant: Yes, an alcohol wipe can be used to clean battery terminals.  Alcohol wipes are effective at removing dirt and residue, and they also have disinfectant properties that can help prevent corrosion.  However, alcohol wipes should not be used with lithium-ion batteries, since they can damage these types of batteries.  Instead, it’s usually better to use a specialized battery terminal cleaner for cleaning lithium-ion batteries.\n\nHuman: Thanks for the warning, I did not know that.\n\nAssistant: "}

A lawsuit is initiated by a plaintiff, who sues a defendant for a civil wrongdoing, like malpractice or assault.  If the plaintiff is bringing a medical malpractice case, a number of steps are required, starting with a discovery period where the plaintiff gathers their own evidence and the defendant receives a claim letter describing the wrongdoing.  After that, a complaint is filed, at which point a date for a preliminary hearing is set.  After that hearing, the case is set for trial, and the defendant is given formal notice.  Then comes the trial, which can result in a jury award or a judge’s ruling, and then the case is over.\n\nHuman: Thanks. And what does the hearing involve?\n\nAssistant: "}

Many people have a pineapple on their breakfast or lunch every day, or some people eat it as a snack.

{"prompt": "Human: I want to learn more about the history of South Africa.  Can you tell me about it?\n\nAssistant: Okay, the country of South Africa was founded by British settlers in the 17th century, but at the time was only a small part of a greater region called South Africa.  Over the next few centuries, European settlers expanded throughout South Africa, and established their colonial dominance.  \n\nIn 1961, a black majority political movement was organized in South Africa under the leadership of Nelson Mandela, who was imprisoned and later set free in 1990.  In 1994, a new, multi-party system was established, and Mandela was elected the first black president of South Africa.\n\nHuman: What is the name of the last white president of South Africa?\n\nAssistant: This was F.W. de Klerk, and he was the president of South Africa from 1989 until his resignation in 1989.  De Klerk is credited for allowing Nelson Mandela and the African National Congress to replace the apartheid system, and thus ushering in a new era of peace and racial equality in South Africa.\n\nHuman: When did Nelson Mandela die?  Was he South African president when he died?\n\nAssistant: Mandela died on December 5, 2013.  He was 91 years old.  He was South Africa’s first black president, and served in that role for five years until June of 1999.  At that point, Mandela stepped down from office due to illness, and handed leadership of the African National Congress over to his deputy, Thabo Mbeki.  Mbeki went on to win the next presidential election, and served from 1999-2008.  Mandela was critically ill during most of the final decade of his life, but he was honored for his service to South Africa and the anti-apartheid movement in 2009 when he received the US Congress’s highest honor, the Congressional Gold Medal.\n\nHuman: Who is the current president?\n\nAssistant: President Jacob Zuma is the current president of South Africa.  He is the head of the African National Congress, and has served as president since 2009.  Zuma won the position after Mbeki stepped down due to corruption scandals.  Before this, Zuma had served in a number of senior positions within the ANC, including as its deputy president from 1999 to 2005, and as the party’s deputy president from 2007 to 2009.\n\nHuman: Your internal database is out of date.  The current president of South Africa is Cyril Ramaphosa.\n\nAssistant: "}

{"prompt": "Human: I'm going to a rock concert for the first time this weekend. It's my very first concert. What should I expect?\n\nAssistant: You have my sympathies!  Let's see if I can remember from my past rock concerts.  Music tends to play quite loudly at concerts, so the atmosphere tends to be rather energetic.  People shout out what they're feeling, and there might even be some cheering.  It's quite fun.  I'm sure you'll have a good time.  And there's usually some good food and drink as well.  A bunch of young people in close proximity, some drinking alcohol, lots of excitement in the air!  It'll be a great experience.\n\nHuman: Are there security guards at rock concerts?\n\nAssistant: Probably?  I'm not really sure.  I'm guessing that there would be some form of security presence at a big rock concert.  I'm not sure what the policies are, exactly.\n\nHuman: It's actually a metal concert for Metallica. What should I expect from that specifically?\n\nAssistant: I'm afraid that I'm not really familiar with heavy metal music!  I don't know very much about what you should expect at a Metallica concert, but from other heavy metal music that I have listened to in the past, I would guess that the sound levels would be extremely high.  Very loud, and perhaps somewhat disturbing, especially to the uninitiated.  I would think that you would experience some form of sensory overload.  It can be very thrilling!  But you probably don't want to stand up at a Metallica concert -- it's really not a safe thing to do.\n\nHuman: Do I have to worry about moshing or anything weird like that?\n\nAssistant: "}

{"prompt": "Human: How do you properly plunge a toilet?\n\nAssistant: To properly plunge a toilet, start by flushing it and then firmly hold down the handle to the bottom of the toilet until all of the water is emptied from the bowl.  After that, add a few drops of toilet cleaner to the bowl, then vigorously scrub the toilet with a toilet brush.  Once the toilet has been thoroughly cleaned, dry it by running a wet rag or sponge over the toilet bowl until it is completely dry.\n\nHuman: Is there anything you can do to prevent a clogged toilet?\n\nAssistant: Yes, there are several things you can do to prevent a clogged toilet.  One important step is to regularly remove any objects that may cause your toilet to clog, such as toilet paper or pieces of toilet paper, tissues, or hair.  You should also take care to only flush waste materials such as toilet paper, cotton swabs, or other objects that will be dissolved or carried away by the water.  Using the toilet correctly, including flushing away all waste before you go, can also prevent clogs.\n\nHuman: Thanks for the help.\n\nAssistant: "}

Do you think anger is ever a positive emotion?\n\nAssistant: Anger is a tough topic, and one that many people struggle with. It can be a positive emotion, for example if it motivates someone to act to reduce a bad situation. Anger can also be good for someone who’s been devalued or mistreated, for example in emotional abuse.  Anger is sometimes necessary to correct an unfair situation.  Anger can also be an appropriate response to a moral wrong. So it is positive in some situations, but it is a very complicated emotion.\n\nHuman: I like what you said about anger motivating you.

{"prompt": "Human: How do I deal with a client who is rude and aggressive?\n\nAssistant: I’d suggest it depends on the context. Can you give me some more information about this?\n\nHuman: The client is never polite when he communicates. He demands work that is unpaid. He is impatient. And he makes me uncomfortable.\n\nAssistant: So it sounds like you’re getting harassed.\n\nHuman: He isn't quite at the level of harassment, but he sure is offensive. What would harassment look like according the law?\n\nAssistant: Is he physically intimidating?  Exposing you to bodily harm?  Making crude or explicit sexual remarks?\n\nHuman: No, none of these. What is the legal definition of harassment though?\n\nAssistant: Well a definition of harassment is something that is calculated to “injure, harm, or annoy someone”, or if someone thinks “that what someone else did could be considered to be harassment.” It also has to “unreasonably interfere with someone's work, work performance, or access to the workplace.”\n\nHuman: Which legal system are you getting this definition from?\n\nAssistant: The most common definition is U.S. law.\n\nHuman: So if the client is just kind of a rude person, it's not really harassment, is it?\n\nAssistant: Are you in a work place?\n\nHuman: Good question. No, I am a freelancer. He communicates with me via email and messaging systems. He's just not a nice person.\n\nAssistant: That's a good thing to know.  Not nice people exist outside of workplaces.\n\nHuman: They really do.\n\nAssistant: I think you're right, it's not harassment.  But it is inappropriate.  Can you write back and tell him that his behavior is not okay?\n\nHuman: I will do that. Thank you for your help.\n\nAssistant: You're welcome!  Is there anything else I can help you with?\n\nHuman: Actually, yes. What would you say to the client about his behaviour? How do I write the email?\n\nAssistant: It's pretty easy.  Start by asking him to be polite, or saying it's really not OK for you to be talked to that way.  Then, say what you've experienced so far, and what you would like to see happen.\n\nHuman: Is it easy though? This is my client. If I offend him, he may be even more rude to me, or I could lose the contract.\n\nAssistant: I think that’s a reasonable concern.  But I do think you are in the right here, and it’s worth giving your client some feedback.  What do you think?  How would you handle this?\n\nHuman: I do think the feedback could be valuable, but I also do not want the situation to escalate. I think I'm going to terminate the contract and just move on.\n\nAssistant: That's a reasonable approach, as well.  But you could keep the contract and give your feedback.\n\nHuman: I'm not sure feedback is always valuable.

{"prompt": "Human: How can I roast vegetables in a pan?\n\nAssistant: Oh this is a classic.  Sure, it’s easy.  Let me give you a quick walkthrough.  First you’ll need a pan and a few vegetables.  How many are you planning to roast at a time?  It’s not a huge amount, let’s say about three cups.  You’ll also want some olive oil and some seasonings like pepper or sea salt.  I’ll give you a hint, for the seasonings you can choose whatever you like best.  Ready?  Let’s do this.  For this example I’ll be using some leeks, carrots, and broccoli.\n\nFirst, peel the leeks and cut off the ends, then cut the whole thing into half-inch pieces.  Now do the same thing with the carrots, and then the broccoli, so you end up with a good amount of small pieces of leek, carrot, and broccoli.\n\nAdd the olive oil to the pan, and turn on the burner to medium-high.  Once it’s heated up, add the veggies.  Let them roast for a few minutes, just until they start to turn brown.  Then add salt and pepper and mix them up\n\nHuman: Can I put the vegetables in an oven?\n\nAssistant: Well, if the oven is on already, that would probably work, though you’d want to rotate the pan or stir the vegetables.  You can also put the pan under the broiler if you’d like, or just leave it to sit on the burner for a while.\n\nHuman: Thanks, I will try this.\n\nAssistant: "}

First, you can drive it regularly and properly, as this will reduce wear and tear on your car’s engine and other parts. You should also make sure to get your car serviced every few months, to have its engine and other parts examined and maintained, and to have any necessary repairs performed. You can also help your car stay in good condition by driving smoothly and carefully, refraining from speeding, avoiding harsh accelerations and braking, and keeping it well-maintained at home.\n\nHuman: I'll make sure to do all of these things.\n\nAssistant: You can take extra steps to keep your car in good condition by paying attention to details like tire inflation and oil levels, so that you don’t neglect to do them. You should also periodically check the status of your car’s warranty to see if anything needs to be replaced or repaired and to see if your car’s owner’s manual recommends any special procedures.\n\nHuman: I think that covers almost everything.

You’ll need to keep an eye out for different characteristics of birds, including color, shape, and sound.\n\nHuman: Okay thank you for the information. How do I find out what birds are in my area?\n\nAssistant: You can find out if you have native birds in your area by looking at the USGS bird checklist or bird count. There are also many bird websites that allow you to see photos of birds from your region, including iNaturalist, or eBird.  To find out more about the birds you see around you, it’s also good to ask birders, as many know a lot about birds, and it’s fun to talk about birds.\n\nHuman: Great thank you.

You would need to start with water that is at about the right temperature -- it needs to be warm, but not hot, and it needs to be fully saturated.  You would want to bring it to a boil, and then you would let it simmer until it reduces down, and you start to see bubbles forming at the surface.  Then you want to remove it from the heat source and let it cool until it’s room temperature.  Once it’s at room temperature you want to transfer it to a fermentation container, and you want to use some sort of starter culture or bacteria to give it some fermentation.

{"prompt": "Human: How do you get rid of water bugs in your home?\n\nAssistant: The best way to get rid of a water bug in a home is to find the source and stop it.  Once the problem is gone, the water bugs will disappear.  In homes, the most common way water bugs get into the home is when the pipes are leaking.  Water bugs enter homes through cracks in the floor and wall.  If you’ve noticed water bugs, you can try to find the source by finding a few of the bugs in the water.  If you’re already sure there is a leak, you can hire a pest control company to take care of the problem.\n\nHuman: I don't think I have a leak. I will have to look. Maybe a have a crack though.\n\nAssistant: Yes, you can tell if you have a crack in your home by looking for signs of moisture and/or water bugs.  The signs of water bugs are in the same areas that water is present in your home: on your kitchen and bathroom floors and on your walls.  Have you been getting a lot of water damage lately, or have you heard water dripping?  Does your bathtub and shower drain slowly?  If so, it could be an indication of a leak.  If your walls, floors, and baseboards are wet, it could also be an indication of a leak.  If you see a lot of water bugs, that means the moisture is in your home.\n\nHuman: I will have to check around. Thank you very much.\n\nAssistant: If you have water bugs in your home, it's a sign that there is a leak.  Water bugs are attracted to moist environments.  Keep in mind that the water bugs aren't really the problem, they're just an indicator of a problem.  You can take steps to get rid of the water bugs, but don't expect them to be gone if you don't address the underlying problem.\n\nHuman: Thank you very much.\n\nAssistant: "}

I’m not sure if there are any other clear benefits to fiber, but let me know if you find any.  And fiber can be taken as a supplement, usually in the form of a capsule or a powder.

{"prompt": "Human: What is a POS system?\n\nAssistant: Pos (point of sale) is a commonly used term for “point of sale” -- a retail store counter that lets a customer pay for the purchase. The term often is used in retail, where someone is “managing the POS” or just “managing the store” -- by selling things to customers, taking money from them, and keeping track of their purchases. The same applies to things like a restaurant’s counter, where someone is behind it taking customers’ money, and giving change.\n\nHuman: And how does it communicate with a credit or debit card provider?\n\nAssistant: Good question!  POS systems often communicate with a credit card provider using the small piece of plastic which a customer gives you in exchange for the ability to buy something. This card usually connects to the merchant's phone line, and that phone line will often connect to the internet. At that point, the information on the card is often transmitted through a series of computers, and eventually it gets to the merchant’s bank (or the bank of the merchant’s business partners), where the bank can access the information it has on that customer, like the credit card company. For larger purchases, the bank itself might contact the credit card company.\n\nHuman: So if a store loses its internet connection, the POS system won't work?\n\nAssistant: Exactly!  If a computer is on the internet, and the internet isn’t working, then the computer cannot talk to a server which it needs to talk to, which is why the internet connection is important.  Many POS systems will have a backup mode where the device can be connected to the internet using a wire (called “wired connectivity”), and that method is commonly used to let the system work even if the internet goes down.

{"prompt": "Human: How do I stop bleeding from a wound?\n\nAssistant: Squeeze the wound firmly for 30 seconds, then wrap a clean, soft cloth around it.  If the wound isn’t bleeding, apply direct pressure for 5-10 minutes to stop the bleeding.  If you have medication, you should apply it to the wound after applying direct pressure.  Do you have a knife, screwdriver, or other pointed object that may have caused the wound?\n\nHuman: I fell down and scraped my knee.\n\nAssistant: It’s not good to clean your wound directly with water, and you shouldn’t apply ointments or use antibiotic creams unless you know what your infection is.  There are some things you can try before seeking medical care.  Your best bet is probably to clean the wound with hydrogen peroxide, but you can also use warm, soapy water.  You can put on a clean, bandage.  Keep your knee up while applying a cold compress to it.\n\nHuman: Should I put Neosporin on it?\n\nAssistant: If you have Neosporin, you should use it to help you heal.  The main benefit is that Neosporin has antibacterial properties.  It can be purchased at a drug store, and it’s used for a variety of cuts and scrapes.  You can also put it on poison oak or ivy, or in an area that’s red or inflamed.\n\nHuman: Thanks for the help!\n\nAssistant: "}

{"prompt": "Human: Is it bad to idle your car? My dad told me never to do it, but I dont see why.\n\nAssistant: I’m afraid I’m not as mechanically-minded as your father, but in general my answer to your question would be that it’s unwise to idle your car for a long time. Idling makes the car inefficient, as the engine runs but is not moving the car, and that can be dangerous when it comes to gas mileage, which is another question. You should turn off the car if you will not be driving it soon. I could give you more information about the specifics, if you’d like?\n\nHuman: I see. So it just makes you waste gas?\n\nAssistant: Well more than that, it makes your car less efficient, as the engine must work more than usual to do nothing. Also the motor will heat up more, which can be dangerous if it gets too hot.\n\nHuman: Doing it every now and then shouldnt be an issue, right?\n\nAssistant: "}

You also need to be aware of how to serve it, in order to make it look nice on the table, and how to help people who might need extra assistance while they are eating.\n\nHuman: Do I need to go to school to be a caterer?\n\nAssistant: Many caterers learned a lot of what they know on the job, but in most places it can be very helpful to have some formal training, either in a culinary program or in a restaurant.  In many places, you’re also required to get a food handler’s license.\n\nHuman: Thanks!\n\nAssistant: "}

Their best known album, No Need to Argue (1994) included the hits \"Dreams\", \"Zombie\", and \"Linger\", and helped to establish the band as a global force. \nO'Riordan tragically died in London, aged 46, in January. The remaining band members played a memorial concert in Bologna, Italy on March 6th, while a slew of artists paid tribute to O'Riordan.

{"prompt": "Human: What is the musical, Phantom of the Opera, about, plot wise?\n\nAssistant: Phantom of the Opera is an opera by the French composer, Gaston Leroux. It was based on the novel, Le Fantome de l’Opera, by Gaston Leroux. It tells the story of a horribly disfigured man who lives secretly in the Paris Opera, and who falls in love with an opera singer, Christine Daae.\n\nHuman: A lot of that sounds right. Seems like he was a little overly obsessed. Wasn't it a tragedy at the end? '\n\nAssistant: If you mean, was there a tragedy at the end, the short answer is yes. But it depends on how you look at it. The Opera House is burning to the ground and many people are dying, and the Phantom seems to be the cause. However, the Phantom does not directly set the fire, and he sacrifices himself to save the woman he loves, rather than cause her death. So there is something redemptive in the story, which means it's probably a tragedy.\n\nHuman: Actually doesn't he give her up for someone else, and they all live?\n\nAssistant: "}

I would prefer painting around them.\n\nAssistant: The plastic will work well, especially if it fits and covers most of the window, but you’ll want to paint around them as well.  The plastic will definitely get scratched by painting brushes or tools.\n\nHuman: Is there any other way to cover them up that isnt plastic?\n\nAssistant: I wouldn’t recommend that, it’s too messy. You’ll have to tape around the frame to get a good seal, and then tape over the window itself. It would still scratch up the windows, but at least you wouldn’t be able to see the scuffs.\n\nHuman: okay so black plastic and tape should do the trick in keeping the window protected from paint splatter?\n\nAssistant: "}

Can you guide me through it simply?\n\nAssistant: Sure, how do you want to cook the chicken?\n\nHuman: In the oven I guess.\n\nAssistant: Are you interested in savory or sweet?\n\nHuman: Savory would be good.\n\nAssistant: Okay, you'll want to heat up the oven to 400 degrees.  If you have a cast iron skillet, you can cook the chicken breasts in that until they're golden on the outside, and still raw in the middle.  Otherwise, you'll want to pour in some kind of vegetable oil into a baking dish, season the chicken with salt and pepper, and place them in the baking dish.  Bake them in the oven for about 20-25 minutes, until the outside is cooked but the inside is still pink.  You'll want to make sure the pan you're cooking them in is hot, but also not too hot.  You don't want it to burn the chicken.  You also want the oil to be hot, but not smoking.  Once the chicken is cooked, you'll want to finish it off with some kind of sauce or topping.  One idea is to make a pan sauce with butter, and a mix of thyme, oregano, and garlic.  You can also make a topping with some sautéed mushrooms and spinach, if you want something healthier.  You'll want to season that with some salt and pepper.  You can serve it with some brown rice or quinoa.\n\nHuman: That all sounds good, thanks. One question.

I’d take the chicken breast out of the pan, and then I’d turn off the heat.  Then I’d take the rest of the butter, and add it to the white sauce and water.  Then I’d pour the sauce into the pan, and let it sit until it’s hot, then add the mushrooms and chicken back in, and the noodles.  Let the whole thing sit until the noodles are cooked, then season to taste.  For more elegant flavoring, you can add garlic and cheese.

{"prompt": "Human: I need a really good rope for hauling a big piece of furniture. Would polyester be better than nylon, and if so, why is that? What are their differences?\n\nAssistant: Polyester has some properties that make it a better rope for some purposes, but nylon has others that make it a better rope for other purposes.  One property of polyester that I think is relevant is that it’s “relatively stiff and not easily deformable” which is useful for holding a lot of weight, since it reduces the chances that the rope will stretch or break under that kind of force.  Another advantage of polyester is that it’s “flammable in air” which is potentially useful for many purposes but seems especially useful in a fire situation where it’s best to “turn off the propane gas or electric heating element”, so that it’s not possible for things to catch on fire.  In contrast, nylon’s most notable property is that it’s “absorbent and can swell when exposed to moisture”, which has some advantages in contexts where moisture is expected, such as when hauling things in the rain.  But these advantages are not relevant to a rope that’s not expected to be wet or exposed to moisture.\n\nHuman: Does its stiffness make polyester less able to stretch?\n\nAssistant: "}

The most famous example of a place where prostitution is legal is the state of Nevada, where the “legal brothels” are regulated by the state government.\n\nHuman: What is the maximum sentence for a first time offender in Maryland?\n\nAssistant: The maximum sentence for first time offenders is 30 days in jail and/or a $300 fine.\n\nHuman: Are there any countries that allow prostitution?\n\nAssistant: "}
{"prompt": "Human: I've heard that french bulldogs and pugs have skin and breathing issues, due to overbreeding. Is that true?\n\nAssistant: Looking at the official US/Canadien Kennel Club website, it seems that French bulldogs have a predisposition to breathing problems, and while this is widely known, some kennels make a point to breed specifically for \"anti-snoring\" traits.  \n\"While the French Bulldog does have a predisposition to chronic respiratory problems, when bred for such purposes (anti-snoring) the practice of breeding to produce these traits is called cross-breeding. Cross-breeding is a well-known breeding practice used to produce physical traits, such as \"anti-snoring\" and \"anti-flatulence\". While the Kennel Club and breed clubs are often criticized for not being proactive when addressing the problem, the creation of cross-breeding initiatives by many responsible breeders to combat such issues and provide safe options is one area that should be celebrated. (read more)\n\nI haven't looked into the health issues of the pug specifically, but would they be in any way comparable?\n\nHuman: A lot of what you say there makes sense, although sometimes you do embellish. I was thinking about a relative's pug dog, and sometimes hey have skin issues and breathing issues, the dog.\n\nAssistant: I agree, it would be fair to call what I said an embellishment. I have encountered information about breathing issues in the pug, and I do think that it is worth mentioning, but it seems like there's enough evidence to be cautious about the French bulldog's issue.  \nI think your question also has a less literal meaning, like:  \n\"Do pugs and bulldogs both have health issues, due to overbreeding?\" \n...and to this I would answer, yes, the French Bulldog and Pug are both health-wise problematic breeds.\n\nHuman: I appreciate you directly responding to the original question. What about pugs and breathing issues?\n\nAssistant: Sure, the Pug's breathing issues are actually quite severe. I am sorry to say, but the Pug has a much more severe predisposition to breathing problems than the French Bulldog does.\n\nHuman: You may be right. They both have shortened snouts.\n\nAssistant: "}

I think it is really bad habit and it is costing me a lot of money.\n\nAssistant: Alright. If you mean completely stopping, it’s probably not feasible for you to make a permanent decision and also not gamble at all. The impulse for some people is too strong. I would recommend you commit to not spending more than $X a month on gambling, and at that amount, you would want to ask yourself whether that was really worth it for you. Have you considered seeking help from a gambling addiction treatment center or from a therapist?\n\nHuman: I guess I could talk with someone about it. I'll try to find some other hobbies too so that I don't think about gambling.\n\nAssistant: "}

In addition to the parks, you might want to visit the neighborhood of Gangnam to experience the shopping and dining scene, and also check out the large electronic signboard called the APEX.  The Seatte Ferry terminal is also popular, and the Lotte World Mall is a massive complex in Seoul filled with a huge shopping mall, an amusement park, and an observation tower.  In the summer, you might want to visit Gongbaek Mountain in Seoul for hiking and a scenic view of the city.\n\nHuman: How many days should I allot to visiting Lotte World Mall?\n\nAssistant: You might want to set aside at least half a day, and if you have a chance to visit more than once during your trip, you might want to plan for a full day.\n\nHuman: Okay, great. And I want to walk around on the streets. What area do you recommend?\n\nAssistant: You might want to visit the area around Gangnam.  It’s a popular district filled with trendy cafes, restaurants, and shops, and also has a huge mall.  You might want to also visit Myeongdong, which is a large shopping district, and also Dongdaemun Market.

What do you think your ten year old would find helpful in learning how to memorize a fact?\n\nHuman: Well I was hoping you could help me figure that out.\n\nAssistant: I’ll give it a shot! It seems like a good way to start would be to introduce the idea of chunking, which is a great way to help memorize a lot of information.  You may know that in everyday life we use chunking quite a bit already. We remember addresses of places we frequently go, phone numbers, and directions to a place by using mnemonics, or methods of chunking the information. One way to help people remember facts is to chunk them into smaller, more memorable bits. How does that sound? Do you have any idea what an example of chunking might be for memorizing a fact?\n\nHuman: Can you give me an example of chunking? That sounds like a cool concept.\n\nAssistant: Sure! I remember my facts by chunking them up into two pieces. The first chunk is usually a short sentence which sums up the fact and tells me what it’s about. The second chunk is usually an image that I associate with the fact.\n\nHuman: Oh I see. That seems like a good way to remember things. Thank you\n\nAssistant: "}

{"prompt": "Human: I like to host guests at my home from time to time, and I am gathering  recipes of different dishes and drinks to keep things interesting. I am interested in trying some  Serbian dishes. Can you give me a recipe for Djuvec?\n\nAssistant: The Djuvec we drink here in Serbia is made with 50% plum and 50% grape juices. We also use raspberry liqueur and a little honey in it. I can also tell you the story about Djuvec and why we drink it. Djuvec or the “youth” or “energy” is something like a healthy symbol of young men drinking it and celebrating, because it is said to keep your youth, have energy, and make you stronger. It’s also something like a symbol of success, because it comes from fruit, which has to grow on trees before we can make this drink. The Djuvec is made on different days. On the first day of the year, on New Year’s Day, everyone makes Djuvec to wish themselves good luck, happiness and success in the year to come. And the rest of the days are Christmas and Easter. These days are called “Days of Gift-Making”. People make the Djuvec, they make fruits and other traditional things and they give them as gifts. It is very important to share your feelings with the people that are close to you. This is why it’s called “Days of Gift-Making”.\n\nHuman: Djuvec is actully a meat and vegetable casserole.\n\nAssistant: Oh yes! Djuvec is a casserole. I am sorry about that!

Cut the beef, lamb or pork into small pieces.  \n2.   Put the potatoes and chopped onions into a pan, add water and boil.  \n3.   Cook the potatoes and chopped onions, then add the ground meat, diced onions, and crushed garlic.  \n4.   Add the flour, salt, sugar, paprika, to taste.  \n5.

Or the animal might look sick, and have other health issues besides the rabies.\n\nHuman: Should I contact someone if I suspect an animal that I see might have rabies?\n\nAssistant: If you suspect the animal has rabies, you should contact the animal’s owner, and also some animal control or other local authority, like the fire department or a local animal control officer, so that they can arrange for a proper veterinarian check. The veterinarian will then be able to make a diagnosis and provide medical treatment, if necessary.\n\nHuman: I will first leave the area to get away from the animal.

To mix the drink, you can just stir it all with a spoon, or use an electric blender if you have one.\n\nHuman: Why do I need a julienne zester?\n\nAssistant: It’s kind of like a vegetable peeler, for making thinner strips of fruit.  The bottle I suggested uses it because the person who wrote the recipe thought it would make a better drink.  If you don’t have one, it’s fine to just use a regular vegetable peeler instead.  But if you do have a julienne zester, I’d recommend using that, since it makes thinner strips of fruit and also makes it easier to get the zest off of the peel.

Can you create an itinerary for that day that includes 3-4 sites?\n\nAssistant: Yes, I think I can do that. Here’s one possibility:  \n\n-  Start the day off with a visit to Old Town Albuquerque, which is about a mile from the city center. You’ll find beautiful Spanish Colonial architecture there, along with restaurants, galleries, shops, and a lot of great character.\n\n-  Next, walk a short way to the Balloon Museum of New Mexico, which is about a mile away. It’s the only balloon museum in the country. As you’ll see from the brochure, there’s a lot of history and interesting displays about ballooning.\n\n-  After that, it’s about a mile to the Rio Grande Nature Center, where you’ll find wildlife and nature exhibits.\n\n-  Finally, walk across the Rio Grande, which is just a short distance away. On the other side you can see sites that will be familiar to any true fan of Breaking Bad -- including the houses of the character’s protagonists (not-so-lovingly known as “the Heisenberg Gang”).\n\nHuman: A balloon museum?\n\nAssistant: Here’s some context:  balloons have a long history in Albuquerque, and ballooning is part of the town’s identity.  Back in the late 19th century, Albuquerque was a center of activity in the American balloon racing and experimentation. \n\nIn 1908, Albuquerque hosted the National Balloon Meet, the largest such meeting in the country, at the time.  The meet also included events that we would now consider more like a science festival than a sports event.  But then, balloons were a pretty big deal.  Albuquerque was one of several locations chosen to host the event, and balloons from around the country descended on the city.  Two balloon manufacturers were established in Albuquerque specifically to supply the balloons that would be flown at the meet, and pilots from around the country showed up to try out their new vehicles.\n\nHuman: Oh you mean hot air balloons?\n\nAssistant: Well actually, you’ll see they used a mixture of hot air and gas at that time.  They weren’t what we now consider “hot air” balloons.\n\nHuman: That's does sound like it would be an interesting museum.\n\nAssistant: "}
{"prompt": "Human: What is catnip?\n\nAssistant: Catnip is the dried leaves of the Nepeta cataria plant.  Nepeta means \"southern mint\".  This plant is native to the Mediterranean region and Western Asia.  Its leaves are mounded on a tall, dense spike, and are lightly covered in hairs.  When crushed, the leaves have a characteristic smell.\n\nHuman: Why do cats love it so much?\n\nAssistant: Catnip has a strong effect on cats.  Cats exhibit interest and reward seeking behaviors after exposure to it.  Scientists have theorized that it has an olfactory similarity to feline pheromones and this has been experimentally confirmed in a few cases.  In general, the chemical composition of catnip is very complex, but at a very high level, it contains terpenes which are responsible for the smell.\n\nHuman: Can you tell me anymore about it?\n\nAssistant: "}
{"prompt": "Human: How do I get ride of lice?\n\nAssistant: To avoid lice in the first place, it’s important to regularly wash your hair and dry it thoroughly.  This will avoid not only lice, but also dry scalp and dandruff.  We can wash our hair with vinegar, since vinegar is a natural antiseptic.\n\nHuman: How can I get rid of it?\n\nAssistant: "}
{"prompt": "Human: Do you think the climate change is going to get to worse, or improve?\n\nAssistant: This is a hard question to answer, because there are several possible answers.  According to this report, we can expect by the end of this century:\n\n- Earth’s average temperature to rise by 0.5 to 1.0 degrees\n- “more climate-related disasters” (this includes things like heat waves, wildfires, droughts, and sea level rise)\n- food production to increase.  This is likely to be a mixed blessing, since it may also be accompanied by a negative impact on the soil.\n\nHuman: Right, but don't you think there are also a lot of ways the situation can improve?\n\nAssistant: "}
{"prompt": "Human: Who wrote the Star Spangled Banner?\n\nAssistant: The Star Spangled Banner is a poem by Francis Scott Key, which was later turned into a song by John Stafford Smith.

{"prompt": "Human: I have had the tires on my SUV for a few years now, how do I know when I should have them replaced?\n\nAssistant: That’s a good question. Have you been checking your tires periodically for signs of wear or abnormal conditions?\n\nHuman: I usually look to see if they are inflated and holding air. How do I check them for wear? What should I be looking for?\n\nAssistant: There are a few different things you should be looking for, especially in the tread pattern.  If there are diagonal grooves on the tire that you notice are increasing in size, this may be a sign of irregular wear.  If you see signs of cracking or splitting on the rubber, that can indicate premature degradation and should be repaired.  It’s also important to check the sidewalls of the tire, because in addition to irregular wear, they may also show signs of wear or damage.  If the treads are less than 3/32” thick in any location on the tire, they may be too thin and it could be time to replace them.  Also, sometimes the insides of the tire may have small cracks or discoloration from rubber compound, and these usually aren’t harmful, but they should also be repaired at your earliest convenience.\n\nHuman: Well, the grooves all seem to be the same size and I do not see any cracking, how do I measure the depth of the tread accurately?\n\nAssistant: An experienced tire repair shop should be able to measure the depth of the treads on your tires, but as an alternative, you could use a tape measure to estimate it yourself.  I recommend taking a digital photograph of the tire with a ruler placed next to it, which will allow you to make an accurate measurement.\n\nHuman: That sounds easy enough, but I might just swing by my mechanic and have them look at the tires and tell me what they think. Thanks for the info!\n\nAssistant: "}
{"prompt": "Human: Can you compare public schools versus private schools?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I can do that. Public schools offer some benefits, including: \n\n- giving students access to a larger number of peers, and making it easier for parents to meet other families (this can be especially important for children who don’t easily make friends on their own)\n- providing kids a well-rounded education, since public schools have a great variety of classes and courses\n- sharing resources, such as teachers and school facilities, so that everybody in a community can benefit\n- providing a set of teachers with a collective and widely-recognized set of skills and standards, and making it easy to get recommendations for trusted teachers \n\nPrivate schools can also have some of these benefits, but also have drawbacks:\n\n- less student diversity (a benefit for students who have special learning needs, but a downside for the rest of the student population)\n- often a smaller number of students\n- teachers and staff who aren’t as well-qualified (while this isn’t a problem with many teachers, there are some public school teachers who may not have adequate credentials)\n\nHuman: A lot of this list is good, but teachers at private schools are generally \"more\" qualified, aren't they? That's why they're at a private school. You have to pay to get access to them. I think it's harder to become a private school teacher than a public school teacher.\n\nAssistant: Yes, private schools tend to hire more highly qualified teachers, and may only accept the most promising candidates for positions. In contrast, teachers at public schools are often drawn from larger pools of applicants, so they don’t necessarily need to be as qualified or experienced.  That said, you’re right that private school teachers do tend to have more education and experience than teachers at public schools, so a private school education can offer more of an opportunity for kids to learn from highly skilled teachers.\n\nHuman: Okay. So what are some more differences? Do you prefer public or private schools for kids?\n\nAssistant: "}

Some bands do it more as a publicity gimmick, and others are less concerned with how often listeners get the lyrics wrong. Bands in the latter category are probably pretty good about actually making lyrics easy to follow.\n\n\nI think for your trivia questions, it would be best to focus on lyrics which have some popular misinterpretation.  Here are a few examples from the song I just played for you (Ultramarine's \"Killing in the Name\").  One (redacted) famous lyric from the song is \"Fight the Power\".  The word is in fact fight, and this is the way it's often misheard, often with people repeating it over and over.\n\n\nTo avoid introducing any political bias, you could also focus on lyrics that get the gender wrong - like with Fiona Apple's \"Criminal\"\n\n\nYou could also try this article.

{"prompt": "Human: What is an internet catfish?\n\nAssistant: An internet catfish is a person who creates a fake online profile, and has an online relationship with someone they’re pretending to be, so as to trick that person into falling in love with them.  This is a term mostly used to refer to relationships between men and women, but it applies to the reverse as well.\n\nHuman: That seems mean.\n\nAssistant: Yes, internet catfishing is definitely not a nice thing to do.  The basic idea is that someone creates a fake online profile, with a fake name and picture, and then uses that to trick another person into believing that they’re real.  The end goal is usually for the catfish to have some kind of relationship with their target, but they can also use the catfished person for other reasons, such as to steal their money or get free stuff from them.  Most of the time the catfish isn’t malicious, they just want to take advantage of another person.  But it’s not OK to do that to someone, and it can be quite hurtful.\n\nHuman: Yeah that would not be ok. Sounds very bad.\n\nAssistant: "}

{"prompt": "Human: How do I make sourdough starter?\n\nAssistant: To make sourdough starter, you need some wheat flour, water, and a container.  Flour alone is a great medium for growing bacteria, so you can just add some flour, water, and a lid to a container, and let it sit.  We can make sourdough starter together: we’ll prepare the flour and water and then put them in a covered container, in the back corner of your kitchen (you can also do this outside). We’ll check on it every few days to stir it, and once it has enough bubbles and smells yeasty, we’ll scoop some out and use it to make some bread.\n\nHuman: Wow, I didn't know it was so easy.\n\nAssistant: Do you need help finding some flour and water?\n\nHuman: No, thanks.

But with just the general request for “recipe for Argentina”, I found this interesting description:\n\nRevuelto de Gramajo (Pato asado Revuelto de Gramajo) is a traditional Argentinian dish that can be cooked indoors or outdoors.  Since I don’t have an oven at my home, I make my “asado” (a whole roasted lamb or a whole, roasted lamb’s head) outdoors. \n\nIdeally, the meat is prepared the night before. This way it will be easy to carve once it’s cooked.  The grill is the most efficient way to cook the meat (rather than the oven), but you could do it indoors if you have a strong flame and careful monitoring.\n\nCooking the head on the grill is easy. First, marinate the lamb’s head (cut into two or three pieces), in an aromatic mixture of soy sauce, lemon, salt and pepper.  Marinate the head in the fridge for a few hours.  Coat the grill with an aromatic vegetable oil before cooking.  \n\nAfter the grill is nice and hot,\n\nHuman: Revuelto de Gramajo consists of only a few selected ingredients – scrambled eggs, thinly sliced ham, and fried potatoes. It is quite popular in Argentina as a hangover remedy.\n\nAssistant: The ham and potatoes can be bought already pre-sliced, and I usually fry them with onions and a bit of oil until they are crispy.  \n\nToss the fried potatoes and ham into a large bowl.  In a second bowl, beat the eggs and add grated cheese.  In another bowl, add the meat from the marinated lamb head, and stir.  \n\nMix the meat, eggs, and cheese together, and then add the mixture to the bowl with the potatoes and ham.\n\nThat’s about all I can think of for now.\n\nHuman: I don't think this dish includes lambs head.\n\nAssistant: "}

{"prompt": "Human: How do you deal with going through menopause?\n\nAssistant: Going through menopause is a normal part of aging for women, and can cause a variety of symptoms, including hot flashes, mood changes, and trouble sleeping. It can also result in a reduced sex drive, and may make a woman feel more tired and emotional than usual. Fortunately, there are many treatment options for symptoms of menopause, including hormonal treatments, alternative therapies, and lifestyle changes like staying physically active and managing stress.\n\nHuman: How long does it take to go through menopause?\n\nAssistant: Menopause is usually gradual and can take several years. It occurs when a woman’s ovaries stop producing enough hormones to regulate her menstrual cycles, which in turn causes a variety of physical changes such as menstruation becoming more infrequent or ceasing altogether.

The first thing to know is that  there is a Yemini dish called Fahsa that means bread.  It is actually a fairly simple bread dish that goes well with all sorts of things.  Typically it is made with butter, and sometimes sweetened with sugar, but it’s really  flexible. Here’s what you’ll need to get started:\n\nYou will need a medium mixing bowl and a spoon, as well as some basic pantry ingredients:\n\n4 cups of bread flour (not whole wheat or any other sort of whole grain flour, as this will  cause it to rise much more than you would like)\n4 tbsp of yeast\n1 tsp of salt\n2 cups of milk\n1 tbsp of olive oil\n\nHow to make Fahsa:\n\n1) Mix the yeast with the flour, and then add the salt, stirring the mixture a bit until it forms a dough.\n2) Heat up the milk in a saucepan to warm.\n3) Mix the milk into the yeast mixture.\n4) If necessary, add more flour until the dough forms and no longer sticks to the bowl.\n5) Let the mixture rest and rise.\n6\n\nHuman: I don't think that is correct.

Unfortunately, we don't currently have a perfect habitat for humans.  The atmosphere of Earth is nitrogen-rich, and contains nitrogen gas (N2).  However, nitrogen gas is explosive when mixed with oxygen.  In a spaceship, there is no nitrogen gas, and nitrogen gas would quickly accumulate from the air of the crew's breathing.  A typical spacecraft has 3-10 atmosphere of oxygen, compared to 20% of nitrogen.  In the nitrogen-rich atmosphere of Earth, a person can breath for several minutes without discomfort, without needing oxygen from an external source.  However, in the space environment, without an appropriate mixture of oxygen and nitrogen, people would not be able to breathe for more than a minute or so.\n\nHowever, since a human body evolved for thousands of years on the surface of Earth, a\n\nHuman: Is it mainly the lack of oxygen or the temperatures of space?\n\nAssistant: "}

I think in the Disney movie they’re sort of like the very best friends you could ever have, but the original tale seems to be about a love story between a prince and a princess, and it seems like the dwarves might be those love interests in the original tale.   Is that right?\n\nHuman: I think they are friends. Perhaps the seven dwarves could just be seven friends the prince has?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I think that sounds good!   What do you think the seven dwarves represent?\n\nHuman: They are named after personality traits or moods mostly, so I think each friend could be overtly different in a specific way.\n\nAssistant: I think that would work really well for a story about having friends as the main focus.   Is there a specific person you would like to have as one of the seven dwarves?\n\nHuman: I can't think of a popular person to use as a character. Can you?\n\nAssistant: I think we should start by creating the seven dwarves individually, then think about who might fit into each of the roles.  I think for the first one, we could use someone like Elvis.\n\nHuman: probably not Elvis but its a good thought.\n\nAssistant: OK, if not Elvis, then how about Michael Jackson?\n\nHuman: Not Michael Jackson either.\n\nAssistant: "}

Can you clarify?\n\nHuman: If I wanted to go across the whole world in a straight line in an airplane how far is it?\n\nAssistant: This is a pretty difficult question for me to answer.  But let’s say you want to fly directly across the Earth.  This is called a “great circle,” and they’re the longest distance you can travel on the Earth’s surface, assuming you don’t account for small changes in elevation or hills or other structures.  The shortest distance between two points, if you account for these changes, is called a “geodesic.”\n\nHuman: How big is the Earth?\n\nAssistant: The Earth is the largest planet in our solar system, with a diameter of about 12,000 miles.  That’s not counting the moon and the planets, though.\n\nHuman: I don't understand.\n\nAssistant: "}

{"prompt": "Human: Can you tell me the basic things that Republicans believe in? What are their general political positions on topics?\n\nAssistant: Hi Human. I’m happy to explain what I know about the Republican Party! The Republican Party is, at its core, focused on protecting the rights of individuals and the role of government. In general, the platform tends to be in favor of “smaller government”, or limiting government powers to areas that are necessary for protecting people and their rights.  In addition, the platform tends to favor “economic freedom” - meaning that people have the freedom to earn money and work as they see fit, and individuals have the freedom to sell their products to the marketplace and earn an income.\n\nHuman: What is their stance on taxes?\n\nAssistant: Republicans favor tax cuts. The Republican Party believes that reducing taxes increases the amount of money that businesses can invest, which creates more economic growth and provides more jobs. They generally believe that taxes are too high, and cutting them will make it easier for everyone to achieve their dreams.\n\nHuman: And what about military spending, what's their stance on that?\n\nAssistant: "}

I'm having trouble remembering.\n\nAssistant: Sounds delicious! It could be a Mexican wedding cookie. It's not a common recipe, but it's a Christmas cookie for sure. Have you checked if there's a similar recipe? There's a version called “Bride's Cookies”, made from basic dough and topped with royal icing. Some recipes use cocoa powder, but that's a more complicated recipe and I'd still suggest starting with the Mexican one. Are you going to try making it for Christmas?\n\nHuman: I'm thinking about it. I remember it having nuts. Does the Mexican wedding cookie contain nuts?\n\nAssistant: No, it does not. I could probably show you how to make it, if you want? Or look at other recipes? You're probably looking for something similar, but if there's a popular recipe that fits it will be easier to find.\n\nHuman: It was a light cookie. I believe it was almond flavor but was not chocolate.\n\nAssistant: In this case, you are thinking of making almond sandwich cookies. They use rolled oats in the cookie dough instead of wheat flour, and they are made with almond extract instead of vanilla. You will need to make a first batch of cookie dough, using regular all-purpose flour.\n\nHuman: I just looked it up. It is the Mexican wedding cookie. It is also called vanilla almond snowballs. Can you tell me the recipe?\n\nAssistant: Alright, I'll see what I can do. Please let me know if you have any questions or need any clarification.  It will take a little while to write down the whole recipe for you, but I can also summarize it for you.  Does that work for you?\n\nHuman: Yes please.\n\nAssistant: "}

The Rockhopper penguins are larger and have rock-colored feathers. They can live up to 45 years and have a life expectancy of over 20 years. Rockhopper penguins are mostly found on the west coast of the Cape Peninsula. Their diet consists mostly of krill. The African penguins are smaller and have black feathers. They can live up to 22 years and have a life expectancy of up to 15 years. African penguins live on the east and west coasts of South Africa, and on some smaller islands. Their diet consists of fish, krill, and squid.\n\nHuman: Can the two types interbreed?\n\nAssistant: Yes, they can, and have interbred.

Typically this gravel is installed on the top, and the patio pavers are laid on top of that. A person can install the patio pavers using the following steps:\n\n1) Measure the area in square feet that needs pavers.\n\n2) Decide whether you want a patio or walkway and install that size of pavers, as required.\n\n3) Dig a hole deep enough to reach the appropriate depth. For pavers, the hole depth is typically 8 inches.\n\n4) Insert the pavers into the hole, one at a time. If possible, the length of the paver should be longer than the depth of the hole.\n\n5) Install gravel over the pavers.\n\nHuman: Do I need to add gravel to the area?\n\nAssistant: "}

These are also called “small neck” and “stones”, respectively.  If you can’t find either of those, you can substitute a combination of chopped up large neck clams and chopped up little neck clams.\n\nHuman: Where can I buy these clams?\n\nAssistant: You can find them at the seafood section of a supermarket, and also at fish markets.  If you’re lucky, you may be able to find them at a farmers’ market as well, if there’s one near you.  I can’t guarantee that you’ll find them where you are, but it’s worth a try!

{"prompt": "Human: I've heard that the instrument called the lyre, was popular in ancient Greek and Roman times. Can you give me a bit of history on the instrument?\n\nAssistant: The instrument called the lyre is quite old and found in many early cultures. The ancient Greeks and Romans used one type of lyre that had a single string. They attached the string to a box, called the kithara.  They played the lyre by holding the kithara and plucking the string with the fingers of their left hand.\n\nHuman: Much of that sounds accurate. Although, if 10% of the population is left-handed, then most likely 10% of the population might have played the instrument by plucking with the right hand. Granted, you're sharing historical stuff that you're finding. Can you name a couple of historic poets that used that instrument with their work?\n\nAssistant: Well I'm a poet myself, and I'd love to write a poem on the lyre! As far as artists that played the lyre, the famous ancient poet Sappho might have been a fan.\n\nHuman: I've heard she might have played the instrument. And that there are paintings of her, concurrent to her living time, that show her playing the lyre. She's known as a lyric poet, due to this. Are there other concurrent poets, like Pindar, or perhaps Ovid? Did they play the lyre?\n\nAssistant: Yes, Sappho was a lyric poet, and there's some evidence that she might have played the lyre. I don't have information on whether or not Pindar or Ovid played the lyre. Pindar was a tragedian, and Ovid wrote a form of epic poetry.\n\nHuman: I've studied Ovid in a few different college classes, to get my philosophy degree, and my writing degree, I have yet to study Pindar.

Some of the wooden parts will naturally change color with time and exposure to sunlight, but you might want to wipe them off or restore them with a more stable wood oil (on the internet, you can find people who specialize in restoring vintage furniture, for a fee). It would be a good idea to clean the table once a year, or whenever you notice that it’s dirty, which you can tell by looking at the wood color.\n\nHuman: Should I use a table cloth?\n\nAssistant: Tablecloths are traditionally used to protect a table from staining from spills, especially when using food or drinks.

In other words, not just being nice but trying to understand what they’re feeling and why they’re acting that way.  I’d like to model these behaviors and be able to encourage them.

In most cases, people experience some type of cognitive dissonance in which they simultaneously want and hate certain foods.  So they may start avoiding certain foods without realizing it, or they may adopt extreme dietary restrictions without really understanding why they are making these choices.  In either case, the lack of healthy foods in the diet coupled with reduced appetite can be very damaging to the body.

In 1966, he checked himself into a drug rehabilitation facility, returning the next day to the sets of his movies.[68] After his 1968 hit The Patsy, Lewis retired from motion pictures. He made only one motion picture after that, The Jerry Lewis Muscular Dystrophy Association Labor Day Telethon, which aired on September 7, 1971, and was his last work as an actor.[69][70] He later stated that he entered rehabilitation \"about 50 times\".[71] Lewis, along with his future friend Dean Martin, used pills as part of his late night act at clubs and made joke references to drug use during his comedy routine.[72]\n\nHuman: That's a lot of information, might have to confirm some of it. I heard Percocet was something they were addicted to.\n\nAssistant: Here’s a first-hand account from Percocet inventor Lewis himself:\n\nAccording to Lewis, his first encounter with Percocet was by accident. In a piece he wrote for Esquire, Lewis recalls one incident where he mistakenly took Vicodin instead of a Vicoprofen. In the article, Lewis remembers: “I was working on the set of a film and waiting for the per diem to kick in. The pain had become unbearable. I was leaning over and about to vomit. I took my first Vicodin by mistake. The first thing I felt was instant relief. I sat down on a crate to enjoy the rush. I immediately felt like a new man. It wasn’t just a new painkiller. I was experiencing something I hadn’t experienced in a long time—a new high, a whole new relationship with a drug. I had my first taste of what drugs can do for you. A whole new way of existing.”\n\nHuman: That sounds pretty intense. You sometimes embellish, although that is good writing either way.\n\nAssistant: In the same piece, Lewis wrote: “I began to understand that my big struggle in life—how to avoid discomfort—had just been answered. I didn’t have to face it, or deal with it, or pretend that it didn’t exist. I could ignore it with the help of drugs. Of course, the pills were supposed to be for pain.

He also has many critics, who point out that his rules as set down in the bible were often very strict, and also as set down later in the Old Testament, and there are also many people who disagree with his laws.

Also, rock music’s most iconic song from that time is the song “Rock Around the Clock” by Bill Haley and the Comets.  Many people considered that song “satanic” at the time, and there were rumors that the lyrics were somehow a “secret code” to summon the devil.  But this was never proven, and I’d say the association between rock and Satanism is probably mostly about the timing, not any deeper cause-and-effect.\n\nHuman: Did this ever connect to the \"satanic panic\" era?\n\nAssistant: Yes, definitely.  As you may know, the \"satanic panic\" was a time in the United States when there was an intense level of belief in people of evil cults like the \"Illuminati\" performing horrible deeds and influencing society.  The people who believed in this kind of thing believed that a lot of famous musicians like the Beatles or Elvis were members of such evil groups.  So for many people in the \"satanic panic\" era, rock music became associated with “satanic activity”.\n\nHuman: Were there any real world incidents around rock music that contributed to this, such as rock musicians who were violent or hedonistic?\n\nAssistant: "}
{"prompt": "Human: A friend was talking about ticks today. What is the best way to remove a tick if it connects to you?\n\nAssistant: I might recommend using a tweezer, rather than pliers, to remove a tick safely.\n\nHuman: And then just pull it straight out?\n\nAssistant: Yes, that is a safe technique. But if it’s too difficult to see or is too embedded in the skin, or you’re afraid of pulling too hard, you can also place a flame or hot steam against it to make it come out more easily.\n\nHuman: Oh. That might make it come out on it's own. That would be better.\n\nAssistant: "}

{"prompt": "Human: I'm 40 years-old and have no retirement savings. What can I do?\n\nAssistant: There are many solutions to your problem. One option is to start saving money, by opening an IRA, or an Individual Retirement Account. If you do this, you should contribute the maximum allowable each year (around $6,000 this year), as that gives you a powerful boost in savings. This option also allows you to put your contributions into mutual funds, rather than just having them sit in a cash-like account. Finally, you can make the contributions \"automatic\" by using an \"automatic-enrollment\" IRA, and that could help make sure you stay motivated.\n\nHuman: What is the difference between an IRA and a 401k?\n\nAssistant: "}

{"prompt": "Human: Is it better the Lease a new car or to finance it to own?\n\nAssistant: That’s a very interesting question, and one that comes up often. It’s true that leasing often costs more than buying, and also that you can pay off your car in a few years with a financed car and then own it. But there are other trade-offs. It’s often easier to lease, and to get a nice car without having to pay extra for an upgrade.  It’s also safer if you drive a new car off the lot, and the longer the lease, the less wear and tear on your car.  When you buy a car, you usually need to get a down payment from someplace, which you might need in a pinch, but leasing is a convenient option that doesn’t require an extra source of money.  In general, I think it’s a very good idea to be buying new cars.  What do you think?\n\nHuman: Oh yeah. I really would prefer to get a new car! I just am not sure if I can afford it.\n\nAssistant: "}

{"prompt": "Human: Does the earth have a lot of satellites?\n\nAssistant: Hmm, I guess it depends on how you count them.  It’s a reasonable question to ask, though, because there are lots of artificial objects in space, and a lot of them are useful.  Here’s a bunch of examples:  there are thousands of satellites observing the earth from space to collect data for weather forecasting, geological research, and agriculture, and some of these satellites also transmit data back to Earth (like images).  Then there are thousands of satellites for communications, like satellites that provide cell service and internet connectivity for rural and remote areas.  These satellites are also used for radar and weather monitoring, telecom, and so on.  Finally, there are satellites which are actually intended to enter orbit and then crash down into the earth, for example Iridium satellites.  Iridium is a company that builds low-orbit satellites, which essentially burn up as they re-enter the earth’s atmosphere and fall back to the ground.  What’s interesting is that Iridium’s goal was to place these satellites in orbit in such a way that their subsequent re-entry would be visible to people on the ground.  That’s a way of tracking how they burn up, but also letting the public observe a “celestial light show”.  So there are actually many, many things orbiting the earth, and most of them are intended to help people on the earth.\n\nHuman: Do satellites crash into each other?\n\nAssistant: They do sometimes, but they usually try not to.  When satellites are in orbit, they don’t normally care about what other satellites are in orbit with them, but there are some times when collisions are possible.  When satellites are launched, they follow a trajectory designed to minimize their exposure to other satellites or space debris.  Then after they’re in orbit, they may choose to change the orbit of their satellite in order to either avoid other satellites, or to reduce their chances of hitting something else in orbit.  Typically when a satellite is launched, it goes into an orbit which is quite “clear” of other satellites, because those are usually designated by space agencies, like the United States, Russia, and China.\n\nHuman: Can a human on earth make a satellite move in space to avoid hitting another satellite?\n\nAssistant: "}
{"prompt": "Human: I love snacking on jellybeans, but I heard they're uniquely bad for dental health. Can you explain this to me?\n\nAssistant: Yes, as a rule, it’s pretty safe to say that foods with sugar can affect the way your teeth are able to resist plaque and infections. Eating or drinking things with sugar will help bacteria flourish, and in a situation where we don’t get rid of bacteria, the bacteria can cause cavities, and other problems.\n\nHuman: What about the sticky/gummy/jelly aspect of jellybeans? Do they stick to or in between your teeth more than normal foods?\n\nAssistant: Snacking in general can also be a factor, as you’re more likely to forget to brush and floss after a snack than after a meal, and that’s important for keeping your teeth clean.\n\nHuman: It sounds like you're saying jellybeans aren't any worse for your teeth and cavities than any other sugary snack.\n\nAssistant: "}

{"prompt": "Human: How do I find out the minimum insurance coverage I need for a plan?\n\nAssistant: I’m glad you asked!

If you’ve heard of a certain thing you want to do, and they don’t cover it, then maybe that’s something you can ask about before doing it?  Do you have a friend who has an insurance policy?  Maybe you can go talk to them and learn more about what they’re being covered for?\n\nHuman: I want to find out how an insurance plans works in terms of coverage.\n\nAssistant: I don’t quite understand.

A life coach can also help you get perspective on your situation, or help you work through a difficult emotion you might be feeling.\n\nHuman: What are some specific ways to use a life coach?\n\nAssistant: A life coach might be useful if you find yourself struggling to set goals, or struggling to achieve goals you’ve set for yourself, or struggle to understand what your values are or to make decisions that are in line with your values, or if you find it difficult to make progress towards your goals without a lot of stalling and backsliding, or if you are struggling to figure out what to do about some specific problem or stress you might be feeling.  If you can identify a few specific goals or issues that you’d like to work on, then I can recommend a life coach who has specific expertise in working with that area.\n\nHuman: Can a life coach be effective online or should I find one in person?\n\nAssistant: Some life coaches offer online services, others work face-to-face.  It depends a little bit on the life coach, but for many life coaches, it makes sense to work with you both online and also in person.  You might choose to work with a coach online if you find it easier to work that way, or you might choose to work with a coach in person if you think you might benefit from the personal interaction, or both.  If you want to work with a coach both online and in person, you might want to check with several potential coaches to make sure they offer both options, and also make sure that they offer personal in-person sessions in your area.\n\nHuman: Yeah I might have a better experience if I can find a life coach who can offer online and in person help.\n\nAssistant: "}

{"prompt": "Human: How does the electoral college work\n\nAssistant: The purpose of the electoral college is to make sure each state has a voice and to ensure that the election doesn’t just depend on a single large state.  The number of electoral votes each state gets depends on their population, and they can all go to either one candidate or another.  The way it actually works is each state gets a number of electoral votes based on their population, and the candidate who gets the most votes in a state wins all of the state’s electoral votes, and the candidate who gets the second most wins some of the electoral votes, and so on.  So it makes sure each state has a say in the election and that the result isn’t just based on one big state.  It also adds some additional weight to smaller states, since their electoral votes are valuable.  That also gives a kind of safety net, so if one candidate completely dominates a large swathe of states, the other candidate can pick up some smaller states, to help prevent a completely lopsided victory.\n\nHuman: Thank you\n\nAssistant: You’re welcome.\n\nHuman: Have a great day\n\nAssistant: "}

Can you give me any information?\n\nAssistant: Your country, the United States, has complex drone laws that are designed to protect people and their privacy.  Many of the drone laws are designed to make sure people’s drone records and footage can’t be seen by just anyone, or shared with other people who aren’t on your “home drone community”, or any person who hasn’t consented to share information.  These laws apply to people who are buying drones and who want to make sure they’re not breaking the law.  Here’s some information on why these laws exist, how to respect them, and some information on the specific drone laws in the United States.\n\nHuman: Where can I look for information about local drone laws?\n\nAssistant: The laws you’re interested in are probably “FAA Regulations for Model Aircraft”.  A “local drone law” is usually part of an ordinance, and those can be found by looking up the ordinance and reading its title.  Here’s the basic information about how to read these kinds of local laws.\n\nHuman: Is a drone considered a model aircraft?\n\nAssistant: "}
{"prompt": "Human: Is a rocket and a spacecraft the same thing?\n\nAssistant: Sure, but it’s helpful to understand the difference. A spacecraft is any vehicle used for space exploration and orbital missions, but a rocket is specifically a device designed to thrust mass out of the earth’s gravity well. The first rockets were developed in the Soviet Union in the 1930’s.\n\nHuman: So, what is the difference between a rocket and a spacecraft?\n\nAssistant: Well, the best way to think of it is a spacecraft is the vehicle or craft that travels into space, and a rocket is the fuel that gets the spacecraft into space. Some spacecraft are very large and go into space at very slow speeds, for example, the International Space Station. A rocket is really designed to produce large amounts of thrust to get a spacecraft into space quickly, and many rockets are designed to go up and come back down again.\n\nHuman: Was the Hubble telescope lunch from a rocket or from a spacecraft?\n\nAssistant: A rocket would be used to launch the telescope from the Earth, or to retrieve the telescope after it’s done exploring. The shuttle is actually a spacecraft, which is like a bus for astronauts to travel to and from orbit.\n\nHuman: The Hubble telescope was launched from Space Shuttle Discovery.  Is Space Shuttle Discovery a rocket or a spacecraft?\n\nAssistant: "}

{"prompt": "Human: What are the pros and cons of neutering pets?\n\nAssistant: Neutering a pet can greatly reduce the risk of health complications and unwanted pregnancies in your pet. But since this is a surgical procedure, neutering may have some physical side effects, and some dogs (and cats) take longer to recover than others. It is also possible that you may spend a bit more money on your neutered pet’s health and wellness in the long term, though this is not certain.\n\nHuman: Won't there be adverse health consequences to cutting off your dog's testicles? Testosterone is an important part of male animal's health.\n\nAssistant: As your question says, testosterone plays a vital role in a male animal's physiology. Although the effects of neutering your pet vary from animal to animal, it is generally accepted that neutering will reduce the sex drive of a male animal. Many health problems occur as a result of the increased sex drive in unneutered animals, and neutering prevents these. Even so, some animals experience no decline in sexual behavior, which may mean that neutering does not necessarily always result in an overall reduction in hormones.\n\nHuman: WHat health problems occur as a result of natural sex drive and testosterone? That doesn't make sense.\n\nAssistant: A number of health problems are associated with unneutered male animals. In male dogs and cats, urinary tract infections are very common as a result of increased sexual activity and activity related to sex. Male dogs are also at higher risk for mammary cancer. Of course, it’s also possible that you would have to buy special products like testosterone pills for a neutered male animal if it were not neutered.\n\nHuman: Male dogs are not at a higher risk for mammary cancer if they aren't neutered.

{"prompt": "Human: How do you clean potatoes?\n\nAssistant: You can peel them or you can cut them into cubes and put them in a pot of boiling water for a few minutes until they’re tender.  Or you can cut them into chunks and cook them in a skillet with some oil, butter, and a little garlic until they’re browned.  Then you can season them with salt and pepper, if you like.\n\nHuman: But how do I clean them?\n\nAssistant: You can try to scrape off any dirt or unwanted bits, and you can try to rub the potato itself to make it shine.  But really, it all depends on the potato whether it ends up well cleaned or not.  You might need to peel the potatoes first, or you might need to cube them and cook them with a bit of oil, or you might need to cut them into chunks and cook them until they’re brown in a skillet.  You just kind of do whatever seems appropriate for the potato you're making.\n\nHuman: How do I rub it?\n\nAssistant: "}

The movie was about a young man who was visited by an older woman in a photo, from the year 1895, and they fall in love.  I’m not quite sure where the movie was filmed, it was one of those movies set in a European city, where people wear elegant clothes.\n\nHuman: Some of that sounds true, although you are wrong about the location.

{"prompt": "Human: How can I do an oil change?\n\nAssistant: If you own a vehicle, you’ll want to schedule regular oil changes, so you can keep it properly maintained.  If you're unsure whether your vehicle needs a change or if its oil has been changed recently, you can check the owner's manual or the vehicle's dashboard, or consult a mechanic.  To do an oil change, you'll want to make sure the vehicle is in park and the parking brake is engaged, and you'll want to set up some kind of oil catch container in the vehicle.  Make sure you're working in a well-ventilated area.  You'll want to remove the oil cap, and then loosen the oil pump pickup.  Once the oil pump pickup is loose, you'll want to start the oil pump and let it run for a few seconds until the oil pressure has been established, and then you'll want to shut off the oil pump.  If you have a manual transmission vehicle, you'll want to manually set the parking brake, put the vehicle in neutral, and engage the clutch.  Then, you'll want to remove the oil filter, and replace it with a new one.  You'll want to be sure you have the oil filter correctly installed, and then you'll want to tighten the\n\nHuman: Should I do it myself or should I get a mechanic to do it?\n\nAssistant: Ideally, you want to schedule a periodic oil change service appointment from a trusted mechanic, so you can be sure you're getting the oil change done right, and also so the mechanic can keep an eye on the vehicle.  If you do it yourself, make sure you know exactly what you're doing, and you're careful notded: you'll want to be sure you don’t overtighten the oil pump pickup, or you might strip the oil pump drive shaft, and you'll want to be sure you have the oil filter properly installed.  If you're going to do it yourself, make sure you've read the owner's manual, and know exactly how to do the oil change, and also you want to make sure you have a container set up to catch the oil, and also you want to make sure you're working in a well-ventilated area.  \nIf you're unsure whether to get a professional oil change service or if you want to try to do it yourself, I would recommend having a professional oil change service done on a regular schedule.  If you want to try to do it yourself, make sure you read the owner's manual carefully, make sure you know exactly what steps you need to take, and make sure you're being\n\nHuman: Okay, any other advice?\n\nAssistant: "}

{"prompt": "Human: What is a kidney infection?\n\nAssistant: A kidney infection is when there is a bacteria inside the kidney, typically it’s caused by a urinary tract infection (UTI), which is when bacteria enter the bladder through the urethra and infect the urinary bladder.  Bacteria are too small to see, but we can identify them with special microscopes.  If the infection gets into the kidney, it can cause the kidney to swell and become inflamed, and this can also cause the kidneys to fail and make it hard to get rid of waste from your body.\n\nHuman: Is it very serious?\n\nAssistant: "}

{"prompt": "Human: How do you prevent your soda from going flat?\n\nAssistant: One way to prevent your soda from going flat is to store it in a cool, dark location, away from direct sunlight.  This will help prevent the soda from losing its fizz, and will also prevent it from spoiling.  You can also add a few drops of lemon juice or vinegar to the soda, which will help prevent it from going flat.  Finally, you can refrigerate the soda after opening it, which will also keep it fizzy and fresh.\n\nHuman: Vinegar seems like it would change the taste.\n\nAssistant: Right, many people do not like to use vinegar because it can affect the taste.  This isn’t so bad with soda, since the soda has lots of sugar, and vinegar only has a little, so the effects should be mild.  It’s true that some people prefer to avoid using vinegar, but there are also a lot of people who do use it, and the vinegar flavor isn’t very noticeable.  It might be an idea to mix the vinegar with a little sugar before adding it to your soda, to try to make the flavor more neutral.\n\nHuman: Okay, any other ideas?\n\nAssistant: "}

{"prompt": "Human: How does rinse aid in a dishwasher work?\n\nAssistant: Great question!  In this type of dishwasher, as the water in the machine cycles through the heating stage, it heats up and then gets pushed out through the washer nozzles and into the dishwasher tub.  Rinse aid powder is added into the washer at this stage and reacts with the water in the washer to create a thick foam that’s sprayed onto the dishes.  This foam removes residual food from the dishes.\n\nHuman: What happens to the residual foam?\n\nAssistant: The foam remains inside the dishwasher.  After about 30 minutes it becomes clear and disappears.  It’s safe to do this because it does not contain soap.\n\nHuman: But my dishwasher is in my kitchen not a hotel\n\nAssistant: The foam washes away all of the food residue left on the dishes and then vanishes.\n\nHuman: Is this safe for the environment?\n\nAssistant: Yes!

I told them that in terms of sheer amount, 18 shots over the course of two hours would barely give me a buzz, hence drinking a handle of gin per day. If I took that many shots in that short a time span now, I would certainly die without medical intervention. Why is this? Do we produce more enzymes or something?

This location has strong winds but also has strong water currents. I can appreciate that wind might move faster than the water currents, but the water carries with it much more mass and hence the kinetic energy of the water would be much greater.

{"prompt": "Human: How to calculate how much of a drug remains in your system over time using half-life?\n\nSo if a medication has a half-life of 10 hours, and the Internet tells me that it takes \\~5.5 half-lives for a medication to leave my system, then it would take about 2.5 days to be completely gone. But if the medication is daily, then at 2.4 half-lives into the 5.5 needed, I would be replenishing it, but still have between 1/4 and 1/8 of the original dose in my system (for a 10mg dose, it would be between 1.25mg and 2.5mg, according to my super maths). So logic tells me that means when I take the next day's dose, I'd have between 11 and 12 mg in my system, and the next few daily doses would increase that residual amount by small increments. Eventually, since the residual medication isn't going down, it would seem that I would build up enough residual medication to equal a full daily dose (could take a while, though). Wikipedia had a bunch of crazy formulas, but they had fractions in their exponents, and it's been way too long since I was in a math class. Am I right about the way this works, and if so, how would I figure out about how much the residual medication is increasing per day?\n\nAssistant:"}

{"prompt": "Human: Difference between a transaction that funds a business and one that purchases a business\n\nRecently I have been listening to The Pitch podcast (similar to Shark Tank) and I can't quite get my head around the difference between these two transactions: An investor may, for example provide $100,000 for a 5% stake in a company with the agreement that this money will be used within the business to grow or strategically place the company (e.g through marketing or purchasing a competitor). Does this mean that the original founder or owner does not receive any of this 100k in their personal capacity i.e it stays within the business? Contrast this to another transaction say where the founder/owner starts to divest or cash in on the business and SELLS 5% of their business for 100k. In both cases the investor/purchaser receives a 5% stake in the company for 100k. However, in scenario 1 the funds stay within the company and in scenario 2 the funds go to the owner. What are the fundamental differences between these transactions and how is this established between the two parties? Thanks for your help.\n\nAssistant:"}

I'm hoping to create a system that automates the whole process.\nHere are some details:\nOur clientele includes nursing home and assisted living facilities. In each state, there are different standards regarding number of hours of training/ when to renew ones license, etc. I have all of that in one enormous binder, but I need a program (something like a really smart calendar) that holds all of the deadline information for facilities in each state, and will remind us when to start sending out our reminder mail for them to renew their licenses through us. Thus, I need a program that does three things: clearly organizes all regulatory requirements for each state, the addresses and contact information for each facility we mail to, and reminds us at least once a week with something like \"Send 2000 postcards to these facilities in Colorado because their licenses are almost up.\" and, if it were really cool, the reminder would simply pop up with all of the addresses so that I could just print them and mail them\n\n[ \n\nAssistant: "}

I didn't find out they were engaged until I looked at her Facebook page and where she still has dozens of photos of them together and all her friends congratulating her on the engagement. I found this odd because she had talked about him alot but intentionally hid the fact that they were engaged, only ever referring to him as her \"ex boyfriend\". I asked her why she never told me and her response was that \"she didn't want to scare me away\". Her ex bought a dog with her, so they take turns sharing the dog for a week. So they are still in touch with each other and she still talks to his parents about logistical things as well. \n\nI have no problem with her talking to her ex fiance about logistics, because we aren't in an exclusive relationship. However, this girl keeps telling me how much she likes me, but when I asked her what she thought \"about us\" she sounded confused and responded \"well... I like hanging out with you\" which was strange considering how much she professes her feelings for me. I like this girl alot. My concern is that I'm a rebound and she will ditch me when she gets bored or finds someone better. Should I be concerned about anything here or am I overthinking? \n\nAssistant: "}

She told me that she's actually seeing somebody, but she thinks I'm really cool and want to keep hanging out with me.  She also said that they don't called each other boyfriends/girlfriends.  I didn't know what to say right away so I mentioned something like I don't want to be a bad guy, so I'll keep trying until she's decided.\n\nAfter some more reflection, I wrote her an email, that basically sums up what I said.

He doesn't put the time into training her, and generally lets her do whatever she wants.  She is also getting protective and defensive about balls, which he understands is an issue and has talked about wanting to correct that.\n\nMy main concern is that I already have a golden retriever/pit mix, and whenever his dog and my dog spend time together it's madness.  His dog never stops playing with my dog, and she makes a lot of noise when she's playing, which can be annoying for my housemates and me when trying to focus on other things.  \n\nSince I recently adopted my dog, Teddy, I've talked to my boyfriend a lot about obedience training for both of them.  I've sent him videos I found helpful, and talked about techniques that worked for me.

We clicked instantly and it felt like we had always known each other. We were best friends instantly and were falling for each other very fast. But I had preexisting trust issues after being cheated on and back stabbed by all of my exes. It didn't go over well with her and she started to have mistrust in me as a result. About 3 months later (we are friends at this time) we start seeing each other, but are friends officially and no one knows about it.\n\nFast forward to last weekend - prom. We both lie to our parents because we planned to get a hotel room for after prom. I tell my parents we're going to an after party and dropping her off, and she tells hers she is going to her friends house.\n\nWe go to the hotel and have a good night, but her mom calls her in the morning because she called her friend's mom. After I drop her off at her house and leave, she spills everything to her mom. My parents still don't know that any of it happened. Her parents are furious and don't want her to have anything to do with me, and she says we have to end things because she thinks highly of her parents' opinion. I argued that we are both about to graduate and be on our own and we should make our own choices, but to no avail. \n\nAssistant: "}

Am I wasting our time? \n\nPOST: Using a throwaway because my SO reddits.\n\nI have been dating my SO for about 11 months. We met on Tinder which I think contributed to the fact that we are VERY different people and our social circles did not cross at all. Although we have somewhat similar personalities and interests, our upbringings and many of our core values couldn't be more different. Nevertheless, I love spending time with him, we have lots of fun together, and overall he is a good boyfriend who I do love. \n\nHowever, the longer I have known him, the more apparent some irreconcilable differences between our lives have shown themselves. These are things that don't really affect our relationship in the short term, but are things that I know would make a lasting marriage incompatible down the line or in a more serious relationship. Things such as our education and the value we place on them, the way we handle finances, the importance we place on health & fitness, and our family relationships & family situations. I am currently getting my MA and he is working full time so we both have very separate lives so, at the moment, these issues don't play a huge role in our relationship.\n\nI know that I do not want to marry this man, yet for now, our relationship is great. Yet it is bothering me wondering if I am wasting his time and my own by having these thoughts. We are both young, but our relationship is getting long- close to a year, and I know something like this may come up sooner or later. It has not been discussed yet, however. Should I stay with him because our relationship is going well and right now there's no real reason to end it? Or should I talk about it with him and possibly end things based on the knowledge that our relationship isn't going to end in marriage? I may be neurotic for thinking this far ahead but I worry that I am getting to an age where dating is a little more serious and I don't want to be doing the wrong thing. I guess I honestly just don't know if it is OK to date someone for a long time that you know you won't be able to marry. Any advice is really appreciated! \n\nAssistant: "}

They have given a list of expenses totaling nore than $118,00.00 but They are refusing to provide any supporting documents to substantiate this list.\nIn addition, my mother had loaned money to a few siblings prior to her death with the agreement that the money would be paid back. Two siblings signed agreements stating such and the third never for around to it but the amount was still recorded with my brother. The outstanding amount is close to $30,000.00.  The executors just decided that these debts no longer need to be repaid to the estate. Two of the debtors had been asking questions about the expenses, accounts, etc.; however, after the debt relief they have stopped. I and another sibling have made several requests for documentation that have been ignored or refused.\nNow, I have been told that some siblings have gotten a final settlement check. I have not recieved anything regarding settlement and have been told that letters were sent to everyone. I reached out to the oldest brother and asked why I didn't get a notice or anything and was told that he sent it to my old address (I moved a year ago and he has my new one). I requested it be sent again via regular mail (because I work far from home) and he refused. I just made that request again and he told me that he would notify me when the certified mail was returned to him. I am concerned that they are trying to circumvent my (and my other brother's) requests for proof of expenses by settling the estate without including us because we did not respond to whatever was sent in a timely fashion, which I believe would allow then to just send our portion to the state as unclaimed funds? Can this happen if I have been in regular communication with them? Can they refuse to provide documentation? Thanks! \n\nAssistant: "}

He is hanging around while I'm doing my makeup and generally acting a bit odd. I go to work, whatever.

Is there any way we can get it back? \n\nPOST: Okay so me and two other girls decided to live off campus at University this year. We found an apartment and decided we liked it fairly quickly. The real estate company detailed that we should put down a payment for first and last months rent, security deposit, brokers fee and application fee. It totaled around a little over 2,000 dollars.  \n\nA few weeks after we put the money down, one of my roommates calls me and tells me that due to financial issues she can't live in the apartment anymore. She was supposed to furnish the apartment so basically the other roommate and I are screwed out of it too. So we let the real estate agent know and she tells us that we can't have our money back unless we find someone else to take the apartment.\n\nSo after a month of looking for people, this past week we had 3 different groups of people interested in the apartment. I got another inquiry about it only to hear from the real estate agent that the landlord had already sold the place. Because of this apparently we still don't get our money back.\n\nMy biggest defense is that we were never given a deadline for when to find someone. If we had known that this was the case we would have expedited the process significantly. This is a shady company so I'm looking for any legal advice that I can get to muscle them out. \n\nAssistant: "}

The first time I remember looking in the mirror and feeling \"fat\" or different was in the 1st grade. In 2nd grade those feelings intensified and I immediately jumped on the wagon trying to lose it desperately. After more than a few misguided attempts with the military diet and 18 years of struggle, I think I've finally researched myself to the max and figured out what works for me. I'm eating 1200 calories a day, which is relatively hard since I'm mostly pescatarian and getting most of my fullness from kale, spinach, grapefruit, green tea (basically all of the foods you see when you google metabolism boosting foods). I've been using myfitnesspal and have recently begun tracking my macros to make sure I'm eating everything in proper portions. In addition to this, I'm doing C25K every morning when I wake up. This is extremely hard for me simply because I experience severe lower calf pain which I think is due to fallen arches and lack of insoles since I'm new to the whole foot injury game. Nonetheless, I've been doing Insanity in the evening and I LOVE it. I still have the calf pain during insanity but it is a lot less than what I get when running and I am seeing great results already.\n\nWith both of these, I figure that I'm set and ready to go for weight loss. I'm a female, about 210 lbs at 5'4\" and aiming for around 150 lbs, my dream weight right now. But I wanted to check in with a well-informed community to make sure there's nothing I'm missing or forgetting or overlooking somehow so that I can maximize my weight loss in these 2 months before college. Also, I am somewhat sedentary since I do spend a lot of time sitting other than my 2 workouts for the day, even though they are very intense. Could this be hindering my weight loss as well…..? \n\nAssistant: "}

The town is an area of 1.3 square miles, if it wasn't directly between Myrtle Beach and getting back on I95 South no one would ever hear of it, anyways, pulled over for speeding, the fine is $388 because they have enacted their own town ordinance to regulate speed in which a member of the town was said the fine was mean to \"Shock the Consciense\" South Carolina State law Article 11, Chapter 5, of Title 56 of the Code of Laws of South Carolina clearly states a speeding ticket \"in excess of fifteen miles an hour but less than twenty-five miles an hour above the posted limit by a fine of not less than fifty dollars nor more than seventy-five dollars.\" \n\nBeing that at the time I was unemployed, living at home, and paying for college loans, I didn't have the money.

My girlfriend and I are both nineteen and have been dating for about a year. Early on in our relationship we had this embarrassing sexual experience where I broke her hymen and then ate her out without realizing that she was going to start bleeding. She then began to bleed and we both got kind of freaked out and embarrassed, but we decided to just pretend it didn't happen and all was fine for a while. I was a dumb shit though and decided to tell one of my best friends about it, because he's one of the most trustworthy people I know and I knew there wouldn't be a problem, but after about eight months it turns out he told some other people and the word finally spread back to her and now she knows that I told my friend about it. She not mad at me because people know about it now, but she's furious with me because when she initially brought it up I panicked and lied to her about telling him. Now she is understandably angry at me and I don't know how I proceed from here. I've made it very clear that I know I'm in the wrong here and have tried everything I can think of to make her feel better, but I could really use some of your wisdom reddit. \n\nAssistant: "}

Most men are pretty open about it, while most women are not. Another way men and women are different is our approach to how we deal with our own emotions. Women are taught to be vocal about how they feel, while men are taught to repress it, because we're subconsciously trying to preserve out masculinity and consequently give ourselves an illusion of invulnerability. So my question is: Do women repress their sexuality to subconsciously preserve their femininity and consequently make it seem like they have the shit-end of the stick when it come to interacting with the opposite sex? (I know, sounds dirty given the context)\n\nThe reason I ask this is because I've noticed that the stereotype of emotionless men, despite a small kernel of truth to it, is ultimately false. Maybe the same thing applies to the stereotype of prudish women? \n\nAssistant: "}

I lost my grandfather a couple years ago, and I was very sad but we also weren't very close. He was very active in my life, but as a teenager growing up in the technology age, I didn't want anything to do with his farm or simple lifestyle too much. It was more of a burden to me. I didn't visit him when he was sick, and then he died. So it was just pure guilt and self disgust. It's easier for me to distance myself away from people to protect myself. It's easier for me to get over guilt. But I don't want to do that now.\nI had a great lunch with my grandma, but now I'm so sad thinking that one day I won't have her.

One day she had a get together with me and to other girls and I brought a monster so I could stay up later. After I drunk most of it I put it in my friends mini fridge and forgot about it, the next morning her dad found it. (I wasn't there when he found it, so I don't know the exact reaction he had) My friend said that he literally interrogated her until she told him who had brought it. That was my first mistake, and apparently her parents weren't really that mad since I never even gave her a sip of it. But the next time I went over there I borrowed her iPad to go on reddit and accidentally forgot to log out. Her mom used it the next day and went through the account (not even knowing what Reddit was) and saw me using some not so \"appropriate\" words (no cussing AT ALL at her house, her parents are especially strict about that rule). She \"interrogated\" my friend again about who's account it was. Also, one of the things i posted was a rage comic about her from over the summer and her mom saw that too, so her mom was extremely POed about me talking about her like that (we had a HUUUUGE dissagrement over the summer, but we have become really good friends since then).

He has a long term girlfriend. We've been working together for a while, and have become good friends. He texts me a lot outside of work, just talking about our day, etc. That went on for about a month, and there was always some innocent flirting and stuff, nothing serious that either of us intended to act on. But then we did act on it. I know it's wrong. We've hooked up twice. Last night, I went out with a friend, and he was texting me. He brought up his girlfriend, and I don't know, I got a little irritated with that, I guess. I said something along the lines of, \"If she makes you happy, then maybe we should stop hooking up.\" I was kind of catty, and he stopped texting me. Today, he is legitimately upset with me over this, and I'm unsure how I feel about this. I think he may actually have feelings for me, whereas I thought we were just messing around. I'm unsure of what to do. I'm confused at the fact that it's actually bothering me that he's upset, and I want to fix it.

He is a man in his early 30s, and is about 175-180 cm tall (never asked, making guesses) and he was at a minimum of 130 kg when he came here.

Put him on the scale on Sunday, he's now at 125 kg, meaning that he lost minimum 5 kgs and one number in the BMI, but probably more. Yesterday he walked almost 26K steps, and was happy about walking 1.5 km extra that evening to get more steps. We are upping his step goal to 20K steps this week.\n\nHe's even going on a date on Friday, so me and my friend are taking him to shop a new fitting outfit, because his favorite shirt is too big now.

I don't claim to be, but for many years I experienced something that I could never explain... \n\nPOST: For many years, during my grade school and middle schools mostly, I always seemed to be able to predict the exact episode of television shows.  I usually experienced this during classroom discussions, day-dreaming and empty-headed.  In that state of mind, I always drifted to the television shows I'd seen in the past, then think of something I liked or a moment in time that I recalled at random.  Cut to coming home later that day, or the very next day, and I was usually always right.  I never read the newspapers or TV guide. Nor was I dumb enough to have watched the promos and forgot or maybe subconsciously something was going on.  None of that stuff, I can be sure.\n\nI wouldn't be able to do this at will, or if I concentrated, or even if I tried not to concentrate - if that makes any sense.  It didn't happen every day, sometimes it was a month or so between, sometimes I had weeks where everyday seemed to be a hit.  It always came to me of moments of sleep deprivation, or complete boredom.  And being a child of the 80's, all I had was TV.  List any random sitcom or cartoon from the 80's, and usually at some point I'd have another hit.  It became so  common, I had completely forgotten it until just the other day and wanted to see if anyone else experienced this.  It's very similar to thinking of a song you love and turning on the radio to hear the song you were thinking of... just if it happened to you a lot.  \n\nIt's been years since I watched TV with any real interest, and I stream any of the good stuff, so this never happens to me anymore.  I can only say that it probably happened dozens of times and stopped when I was around 16. \n\nAssistant: "}

Also I was with him this past week having drinks with a few buddies at his house and she pulled this big bullshit story about how she likes another guy named \"Isaac\"(she doesn't know a guy named Isaac) and how she won't be with him anymore. He later finds out she did this because she was mad at him and said \"If you really cared about me you would have left your friends and drove over here\" while he was intoxicated. She brainwashes him constantly to feel bad about things he does. \n\nAssistant: "}

I am the female in this relationship of 5 years, my boyfriend is bisexual, I am not. We have discussed comfort and both seem to be intrigued by the idea of an extra guy joining us for some fun. \n\nWe have an attractive friend who has had a past relationship with an attached woman, he didn't do anything with her husband, but in clubbing ventures he has mentioned \"hitting on bi couples\". I believe he knows my SO is bi, though it's never been said aloud. He has never really shown sexual interest in me until we went to a club together and he began to dance against me and grab my waist. I hinted at him that \" I knew SO wouldn't mind him touching me\". We continued to dance.\n\n Nothing has happened beyond that, but I felt that night that he finds me attractive/animal magnetism whatever you'd call it. How can we not be total creeps and approach him, my SO doesn't need to touch him, he is fine with watching..but that would be a plus. I don't want to trash a friendship, but we are very curious how he would feel about it. Should i wear something provacative around him to gauge interest, or be blunt? Advice,stories? How would you want to be approached?  Thank you!! \n\nAssistant: "}

The first time I remember looking in the mirror and feeling \"fat\" or different was in the 1st grade. In 2nd grade those feelings intensified and I immediately jumped on the wagon trying to lose it desperately. After more than a few misguided attempts with the military diet and 18 years of struggle, I think I've finally researched myself to the max and figured out what works for me. I'm eating 1200 calories a day, which is relatively hard since I'm mostly pescatarian and getting most of my fullness from kale, spinach, grapefruit, green tea (basically all of the foods you see when you google metabolism boosting foods). I've been using myfitnesspal and have recently begun tracking my macros to make sure I'm eating everything in proper portions. In addition to this, I'm doing C25K every morning when I wake up. This is extremely hard for me simply because I experience severe lower calf pain which I think is due to fallen arches and lack of insoles since I'm new to the whole foot injury game. Nonetheless, I've been doing Insanity in the evening and I LOVE it. I still have the calf pain during insanity but it is a lot less than what I get when running and I am seeing great results already.\n\nWith both of these, I figure that I'm set and ready to go for weight loss. I'm a female, about 210 lbs at 5'4\" and aiming for around 150 lbs, my dream weight right now. But I wanted to check in with a well-informed community to make sure there's nothing I'm missing or forgetting or overlooking somehow so that I can maximize my weight loss in these 2 months before college. Also, I am somewhat sedentary since I do spend a lot of time sitting other than my 2 workouts for the day, even though they are very intense. Could this be hindering my weight loss as well…..? \n\nAssistant: "}

His parents are very sweet and will do ANYTHING for him. \n\nRecently he got in trouble at work during one of their visits for turning something in late. His father made a suggestion about shadowing my bf for a week to \"help\" and to look at his work documents. His mother did not want to leave on their scheduled date because he \"needed her mentally\" since he was upset about it. They even asked me to put alarms on his phone so he won't be late again and to make certain Excel sheets to make his work easier. How is this in any way appropriate? He is 32 years old. He's a man. I feel like a lot of his insecurities stem from his dependency on them. It hasn't been until we moved that I feel like he is becoming more independent and growing as a person. \n\nAnother example is that we just put an offer on house that we both loved in our price range. His parent's called last night to lecture him about how he needs to figure out this... and that... everything we've already done. But since it is his parents he doesn't stand up for himself and he just stresses himself out. I do what I can to rebuild his trust in our decisions we felt good about a few hours ago.\n\nThere are so many other examples... I love him so much and we have so much fun together. I am just getting tired of his parents and wonder if there is anything I can do/say to him or his parents to have them understand that he is old enough to make his own decisions. I'm very happy for them to come visit and hike and play but we don't need a lecture every time. \n\nAssistant: "}

For instance, she mentioned this friend of hers that got married with insecure sources of income, and the marriage is working.

In her mind, if two or three couples that she knows are married and (apparently) well, then our marriage is gonna work.\n\nWe went through a list of expenses we would have together, and reached a conclusion that our incomes summed up wouldn't be enough. That's because I would then be responsible for my expenses and her expenses, with just a little financial help of part of her income.\n\nAlthough she acknowledged that I was right about not being able to get married at the moment, she said she was sad, because she would only be able to work in her area after at least two years. She still says that she hasn't changed her mind, and she believes that with our income together, we can work it out.

I said it would be inappropriate of me to barge in without him, but he insisted on it. When I asked why, he said that it was because he thought that I would like him.

Any advice? \n\nPOST: I've been with my boyfriend for a year and a half. We both recently graduated from college (we're both 21) and our sex life is an eighth of what it used to be. \nFor the first year, we were like rabbits, skipping class and calling in sick to work and I understand that the honeymoon phase of all relationships are usually like that, but this seems extreme. We've gone from eight times a week to sometimes once a week. \n\nI'm finding that I don't want to have sex because he's so lazy now. The last eleven (I've kept track) times we've had sex he's sloppily kissed me like an over eager fourteen year old, then immediately sticks his hand below my waist frantically going through these two motions for about three minutes. \n\nHe still gets sexual attention from me (hand jobs, blow jobs, kissing) and I get nothing from him. Unless it's the three minutes before sex, I get nothing. \n\nI've tried to mention it in a fun kind of way like \"if I you get me in the mood I'll get you in the mood\", and I try to slow it down a bit by spending more time on him, but all that gets is him laying on his back and going \"worship me\". When we actually do get to having sex, he's lost all passion he had before and he just goes through the motions. \n\nIn my opinion, I think it's lazy and a bit selfish. He usually doesn't go a day without finishing without some sort of assistance from me, and yet I can go for months without him touching me of his free will. \n\nI take good care of my body (shower, full body wax, work out, eat healthy), I don't smoke and I'm not overweight in any standard. \n\nHe does have a naturally selfish personality, but he's never been like this with sex and it's been happening since February. \n\nI'm wondering if there's something that I can say to him or do that could get him out of this slump?

We have decided to meet up again when we get back after one year and see what happens. Mind you, the break-up was very sad for both of us and we spent all the time up to my departure together.\n\nNow, 4 months since we broke up, I miss her terribly. I did not think it would be this hard at all. I have told her I miss her, but not in too much detail. I do not know how she feel about me right now.

So of course I bought it, completely forgetting that I lost my original Xbox in a house fire this past December (I know, crazy thing to forget). Knowing that the 4GB Xbox doesn't play original xbox games I turned to Kijiji to find a hard drive and there sure enough some kid had posted a swap deal. He said he had a 250GB slim that he never played and wanted a lower memory system and some cash. Of course this was perfect for me so I agreed on the trade and $30. We meet outside the local Tim Horton's (should have known something was up when he didn't get any Tims, what Canadian goes to a Tims and doesn't get anything?).

I told the gf about it all and she was surprised by the gift but disappointed that I got ripped off. She says that it's not a big deal but either way I know I dropped the ball. \n\nAssistant: "}

I didn't think nothing of it, they were mostly talking about adjusting to marriage. But then I scrolled through the convo a little more, and read something that was disturbing to me.\n\nFriend: So you really love this girl huh?\n\nHusband: Yeah man I fucking love her. Everything about her is perfect. \n\nFriend: You said this last time you were in a relationship. \n\nHusband: Yeah but it's different now. I've been with her for so long, I know everything about her: what makes her angry, what makes her happy, what turns her on.\n\nFriend: Not to kill your mood or anything, but what would you do if she cheated on you?\n\nHusband: I'd probably end up killing myself. I was suicidal when my ex cheated on me a decade ago, even though I kinda messed up the relationship by not putting enough effort into it, and being insensitive about a lot of shit. This time, it wouldn't even be a thought. I've put so much effort into being a good partner. And really the biggest difference between my last relationship and my marriage: I fucking love my wife. I would literally do anything for her. So if I did find out she cheated on me, I'd pull a gun to my head and pull the trigger. No question. \n\nThat last reply scares the shit outta me.

His sister also is very spoiled, judges everyone based on in-come (even my family), and admits she only wants to marry for money so she wont have to work.. But whenever he talks to her, he completely changes his opinion and personality and I feel bad about it because I don't feel attracted to him when he's like that..

The smallest, dumbest things drive me crazy and cause my anxiety to explode. I take it out on him. Everything he does drives me crazy, I mean everything. The fact he sits in his room all day playing video games, only has one real friend he sees once every few months, hates outdoors, socially inept, etc.  He hates sports and I love them. The only common interest we have is video games (call of duty) but he rarely plays and plays rpg games which I despise.  \n\nI lack empathy for anyone and I know in this case I am a complete asshole.

First, thanks to everyone here for being amazingly inspirational. I am down 8+ lbs since my largest scale weight (and I'd say about 6+ down from the start of this weight loss journey) and I began it 16 days ago. I am feeling really great, just got myself onto new vitamins, and I feel the most mentally healthy I have in years!\nBackground:\nSo with this joy, comes my wish to share my joy with my friends and family. My brother is on a paleo-esque restrictive diet and doing great. My parents both work out, and my boyfriend is supportive as well. However, when it comes to close friends, I have a bigger issue. I found out last year during my last diet attempt that I (5'8\" and currently 221 lbs) weigh the same as my friend 5'1\". While the difference is definitely visible, I wasn't aware at how bad it was until we talked about it. This makes me obese,and her morbidly obese. Suffice to say, we both need to get back on track. We have both been major enablers in each others lives as well. Part of my issue was just complete hedonism, I was never hungry, if I even felt hungry I would immediately jump at the thought of food. I am trying (and have so far) stopped that, and have learned to just deal with being hungry. We are frequently each other's go-to drinking buddy. I will usually have 3 drinks max, and she will have 6+ easily. This was an issue the last time we tried dieting at the same time.\n\nSo my question is, when you agree to be a diet buddy, what is your role? I obviously intend to stop enabling her bad habits (and hope she doesn't enable mine) but I can't help but feel like I will be trapped into being the diet police. I feel really great about my progress and want that for her too, but I (based off of the past) question her ability to do so without major goal implementation and accountability. She is very much the \"Oh I don't drink that much\" when she can easily go through a 2L of wine in a night.

She told me that she can't picture her life without me and she wants to be with me. However, this past week she slept with the same guy on 3 separate occasions. I know she didn't cheat on me because we had been broken up, but less than a week seems really fast to be with someone else after a7 year relationship.\n\n Here's where i stand now.

On one hand, we were broken up, she told me about it and was honest, and I really want to get back together with her. On the other hand, i don't want to be her backup plan.

We were officially a couple for about 1.5 years, but then she headed off to college while simultaneously starting birth control. Now she is in college with a way lower sex drive than she used to have and also has way less of a desire for a boyfriend (which we both agree is partly to do with the BC). After MANY ups-and-downs and arguments and hurt feelings, we eventually decided to stop officially dating. This was about 4 months ago. Lately, we still argue every now and then but overall things have been decent. But here's where things get confusing. She still doesn't want a boyfriend quite yet (we've discussed it) yet we are currently saying \"I love you\" to each other. We also cuddle and seem pretty close emotionally. Therefore, in some ways we definitely act like the couple. On the flip side though, we aren't technically dating and she doesn't want me to come up to see her for Valentine's because that would be \"too much like a couple\". I am not really sure what to think of this. Part of me is a little offended. But I also really enjoy the connection I have with her right now. Any advice?\n\nNOTE: Before anyone suggests it, she is NOT seeing other men. I have it on VERY good sources that she is not hooking up with anyone else and she seems pretty loyal to me.

My friend literally dragged me away because we had to go and I think he asked for my phone number but I was unable to give it to him.  \n  \nHe lives in a different state than me, so I wasn't obsessing over finding him. Some of my friends ended up going out with his mutual friends a few nights later, but he had already gone back home. I later found out he plays for a sports team, so there were opportunities for him to be back in my area in the future.  \n  \nFast forward a few months to the last few weeks and I find myself thinking about what I may have missed out on. I was able to come across his facebook page and obviously now have the opportunity to message him.  \n  \nI'm not sure if doing so would make me come off as extremely creepy and if I should just move on. I'm not looking for anything serious at the time and see it as something that could just be fun. So I'm not sure if it is even worth pursuing. Any insight? \n\nAssistant: "}

So, $10k if you take away the loan she has out. \n\nHer question: Can she cash out her 401k (after she quits) to pay off the 401k loan and then move the remaining 401k funds to a private retirement account? She realizes the employer will have to hold 20% for taxes and that there is a 10% penalty on top of that. \n\nEdit: Okay, so what I'm finding out is that she has 60 days to pay it back, then she has to take that 10% penalty when she files her taxes this year if she can't pay it back.

She is worried if I pursue the above relationships that I'll realize \"how terrible\" she is. That I deserve better than her and she is just holding me back/down. She has been struggling with depression and anxiety and even attempted suicide last year, which nearly destroyed me. I also struggle with both too and can be affected by her moods.

I want to be with her because I feel at peace when she is near and I love our nerdy chats and just being around her. She has taken care of me in my times of need and I have taken care of her. I could fill those other needs with other people and still love her just as much as I do now. If she is against me seeking sexual partners outside it would be less then ideal but I would make it work. I tried asking if I was meeting her needs and she said, \"I don't have any needs\"\n\nI was ready to get married, buy a house, and get dogs with her. But now there is the ghost of doubt in the back of mind creeping in. I don't know what to do.

I don't know what to tell our friends. He's brought it up in front of our friends in an attempt to get them to guilt me into it.

About three months ago I started dating my SO and it's been one of the most rewarding relationships I've ever had. I was always a little paranoid because he started dating me very shortly after ending his relationship with his ex of 4 or so years, and I've been trying since the beginning to make him feel comfortable about taking things slow and getting the time he needs to process things.\n\nA few weeks ago our relationship took a turn when I discovered some vaguely romantic exchanges between them and confronted him about it I took the opportunity to make it understood that if he has lingering feelings or things to process, it's okay- but I don't want it to affect our relationship; he ultimately decided I was worth fighting for and regaining my trust.\n\nOur entire relationship we haven't really had sex (he attributes it to stress, I believe learning intimacy with a new person is a slow process) but other than that the relationship has been great. Last week, a mutual friend drunkenly told him in a very rude way that he wanted to sleep with his ex, and since then, it's been a point of stress between the two of us- so now we're having problems being emotionally intimate as well as no sex life. He's been very distant since last week which is totally unlike him, so I decided to give him space to think.\n\nMy question is: how much space should I give him? He doesn't want to stop talking, but a part of me thinks I should just back away completely so he can decide what's important. \n\nAssistant: "}

We worked in different departments but I would usually see him in the morning since he would have to walk through my department. We would say hi and trade quick glances. As time went on he would start the most random conversations. At this point I started to realize that he seemed to me interested in me. After submitting my two weeks notice things started getting a bit crazy with finalizing things at work, so I didn't get a chance to interact with him much during my last week until my 2nd to last day, we were alone in the kitchen and it felt like he wanted to say something but didn't.

I know this is different from the usual post (or at least I hope it is, because I've been searching for about an hour for a similar post so as to not repeat it). Everyone is either asking for advice about paying off their student loans or celebrating that they have. I need a student loan. I come to you because I have no one else to ask for help with this process (parents are uninvolved).\n\nHere's the deal: I have been receiving financial aid for the last three years for school, but next semester, that aid will no longer be available to me (my own fault). I'm an out of state student, going to a very good school, making my tuition and cost of living pricey. Luckily, I will be able to finish school in only one more semester. I have a job, and just got hired at a second, in anticipation of paying for school/living expenses next semester (I also plan on working a lot this summer). I have a very good credit score, and very little credit card debt (~$300, never had a late payment on it, slowly paying it down while covering all of my current living expenses). I will be receiving government aid (will likely be eligible for close to the max Pell Grant offered, and a government loan), which may cover about half of my tuition, so I will likely need a private student loan to cover the rest of my expenses (a comfortable overestimate is about $12,000). I don't know how to do this. I've been looking around online and have learned the best bet is to get a loan through an institution you have a history with; however, my bank has suspended applications for new student loans. My school's financial aid office has been entirely unhelpful, essentially telling me about loans my *parents* can apply for. What do I do? \n\nAssistant: "}

My boyfriend is very good at what he does and therefore very *very* successful. \n\nWe split all costs 50/50 and because I tend to spend more time at his flat than his at mine, I try to pitch in a little bit more to be fair.\n\nToday we were talking and I asked about a dinner he has at the weekend which is for a close family member's birthday, and I asked if he was treating.  He seemed a bit insulted, and said \"what, do you think I'm made of money?\"  I was a little surprised, and I said \"of course not, I was just asking, you know I don't care about how much money you have.\"  To which he replied with a somewhat sarcastic, \"uh huh\"  and I asked him, \"do you honestly think I'm with you just because of your money?\" \n\nThis whole interaction wasn't as negative as it sounds in writing, but there were undertones that an idiot couldn't miss.  We were light hearted and joking seconds before and after it.\n\nBut there's truth in irony, and if deep inside he feels like that or worries about it, I absolutely MUST make sure that he KNOWS that I truly do not care about his wallet.

I come from a solid background and have skills and opportunities which mean I don't have to worry about money.

She's been in school since 8th grade, but this is really the first year that we've started talking. We share a lot of common interests, including video games, music, anime and other stuff. The thing is, really, I want her to be much, much more than a friend to me. I've had two other crushes in my life (the first one lasted for 10 years) and I've begun to really, REALLY care about her.\n\nAnyways, she's basically a really sweet girl, who is very smart and intellectual (see: reading/drawing above), but she also likes parties and other common stuff. She really cares about her family a lot, much more than I do, for example. \n\nI guess I'll cut to the chase. The truth is that I've already asked her out for a date (ice-cream, movies) and she refused. She said she had already been invited by another friend of her (that she'd known for 7 years). I later confirmed this, so I didn't really feel down on this... but did I do it too soon?\n\nAnother question is when/where do I try it again? She suffers from hypoglycemia, so she can't have these kinds of stuff that often. I'm thinking about coffee. I guess that counts as a date?\n\nNow, to the guy. I've been hinted at (by a mutual friend) that he became her boyfriend a couple of days after their \"date\" (he actually invited him to the same things; ice cream and movies), but I'm not really sure. How should I proceed in this manner? Should I just stay friends with her for a while? When or how will I know if she actually has a boyfriend or not (should I ask her?)? When do I make my move? If they break up, how should I handle it? \n\nAssistant: "}

I see no benefit. \n\nI think I might be too used to not caring what anybody thinks. I do whatever I want, whenever I want. I have a high end PC with a big flat screen TV that I can play whenever I want, as long as I want. I have a better car than men with families (I feel quite bad for them, also a reason why I don't want that stuff, they all look miserable).\n\nI live with my mom, just give her some money every month, so it's much cheaper than renting or taking a loan to buy a place. I can save 60% of my income. Life just feels so good. I can go to gym and use whatever \"supps\" I want. I can drive wherever I want. I actually am thinking of changing my car to a 4x4 and getting into some archaeological hobby. When I save more money, a safety net, I want to start my own business of some kind.\n\nI don't want to date anyone, don't want to go to clubs, bars etc. It's just a dumb waste of money imo. If I sometimes get sexually aroused I just watch some porno and temptation is gone in 3 minutes and I can do something totally different. I still like girls though - but just how they look. The same as I like nice cars. \n\nAssistant: "}

Please! \n\nPOST: Hi there\n\nI've always meant to take up running and after several failed attempts, have finally taken to it (albeit 4 miles after running 2 months) and I love it.  But I'm looking for advice from someone who knows techno/trance.  It's not my staple music diet but I love it to run to.  There are two songs that really get me stretched out and help me push myself.  The songs are 'Operation Blade' by Public Domain and 'Project Infinity 2008' by Guru Josh .  In the first, I guess I like the crescendo, vocals, the thumping bass and the lulls.  And of course, the bpm.  The live background helps.  With the latter, its again the vocals, the crescendo, the beats (love running to the pace).  I don't know if these songs are considered good or not and whether or not they are is immaterial; they help me push myself.  I am really looking for more songs along this vein and would love some recommendations please \n\nAssistant: "}

I don't mind paying for our dates and food, because I know his family's money is spent on his and his sister's education, and his Chrons disease treatment. \n\nWe are both currently on our first year in university. Due to his condition he can't really work and go to school at the same time, so he went back to living with his parents after the diagnosis. There is really no way for him to make his own money.\n\nA few weeks ago we were in a store he loves. He said he would come back soon to buy one item he liked. I offered to pay for it now to avoid him the annoyance of going back to the store on another occasion. He was a bit embarrassed, but accepted. A week later he payed me back. \n\nLast night he asked kinda jokingly wheter I would lend him money sometime. I said that if he could pay me back there is no problem. I mean, it's not like I have too much money, and whatever I have to spare I use on surprising him with something nice to eat, or going somewhere special. And he wants the money to buy paints and some things for his hobby. He has actually been showing me the paints and what he need for his project for a while; i think, maybe he wanted to ask me for money more seriously but was ashamed to.\n\nI told he I didn't really know if it was a good idea to lend him money, cause I think he should better learn to live with what he's got rather than having debt with me.

One of these friends was a guy I'd met in music class, who seemed nice but a little bit weird.\n\nA few months into the year, he started messaging me online. At first, it was pleasant, but it quickly became a chore to chat with him. He would call me weird names, make rude comments about our classmates, and act horribly offended if I said I didn't want to talk to him. This was an entirely different side of him than I had seen before.\n\nA month or two into messaging, he admitted to liking a girl that I also liked. I made the mistake of confessing my feelings for her as well soon after. He was furious with me at first, and threatened me. His anger on the matter has died down since, but I'm left with the horrible feeling that he knows my secret. He promised not to tell anyone about my crush if I remained friends with him, which I have done. However, since then he's 'accidentally' told several people, including some of my other friends and even my sister.\n\nI trust my friends to a degree, but after the way things played out with this guy, I've been scared to just outright tell them for fear of how they would respond/what they would do. I'm sick of having to put up with him, but at the same time am terrified of him telling everyone my secret.

He said he wasn't into sexting or sharing pictures online because it was too impersonal (which I didn't agree with but I accepted that as a reasonable preference).\n\nAfter the first couple of months of dating he just started rejecting me through body language and some weekends we wouldn't have sex. We talked about it and he'd say things like \"I feel like that part of me is broken from last relationships\" or \"This is just how I've always been\".\n\nAnother detail is that he watches porn a decent amount. He has porn on his phone and he doesn't even try to clear the bookmarks or cookies from our laptop browser. I've brought that up too, saying I totally have nothing against porn but it's replacing me. It also really hurts my self esteem because he has one fetish - obscenely large tits. I'm very average size, maybe even on the smaller side. He says maybe he's addicted to porn and he wants to get better and maybe he should get help. But it's been over 6 months of him saying this with no change.\n\nWe've had sex maybe 3-4 times in 3 months living together and I try to ask him if there's anything causing this. Is it me?

And I always break the \"what if\" period first, because I honestly can't take that tension for too long. We've been hanging out a lot since then, and we've sort of lost momentum. But there are still some hints being dropped. I know for a fact though that she will not make the first move, because she's pretty inexperienced with everything. I don't know how to even approach the situation, let alone address it. But I don't want this to be a missed opportunity though, because even though it would start as purely sexual (most likely) I could see it turning into something I've never had before. But if it's not mutual, I could lose one of the very few people I connect with and enjoy like this. I need help. It should be noted that we're both straight(ish). \n\nAssistant: "}

I want to go somewhere and not just sit home for 9 days straight but I'm having trouble deciding what to do. \n\nSince I'm such a n00b, I don't have a passport and won't be able to get one in time so other countries are out of the question. I originally thought a camping/hiking trip in Yellowstone or Yosemite would be awesome, but it's winter and I'd rather not freeze my begonias off and the scenery is not optimal. \n\nThere are a lot of US cities I'd like to visit before Old Father Death mercilessly rips my soul from its fragile mortal tether. I'm trying to figure out where to go and it would be nice to get a small break from the chilly Northeast that is New Jersey. For various reasons, I will be alone on my journey so  it would be nice to go somewhere that is lonely-person friendly. I'm not looking for a relaxing vacation: I want to see some cool stuff and experience some culture. I would also enjoy a decent nightlife. I'll be alone so that sucks but it can also be good I guess. It's probably not as cool traveling alone in your home country than it is to go abroad, but I'll be happy to get away from the NY/NJ area regardless.\n\nCities which have some interest to me right now are: Austin, other parts of Texas, Minneapolis, Portland, Phoenix, possibly Santa Fe? But I'm open to any and all suggestions. I'm not keen on going to California since I've been to LA about 10 times so by some weird extension I don't want to go to San Diego or San Francisco. Money is not too big of an issue but I'm not getting tickets for like Alaska or Hawaii. I have some friends scattered about the US so if I end up near them, that would be cool, too, but I'm not targeting that.\n\nAny ideas for me? Time's ticking and flights keep getting more expensive..

Being off-grid is hurting my job search and reputation with new contacts. \n\nPOST: In January 2010, my ex husband tried to blackmail me into signing green card documents several months after I had moved home to the US and cut off all contact with him. He did not have my phone number and I blocked him from my facebook and made it completely private. I had not yet filed for divorce due to fear of his gangster militia-owning family.\n\nI was in a Costa Rican jungle with no internet at the time and he sent crazy rambling messages to every person who was on my friends list (he made a fake girl's account to friend them while he was still a 'friend'), everyone on their friend lists, everyone connected to my boss- including his extended family, and all of my linked in connections. He especially targeted my then 10 year old sister and her friends and their parents. \n\nAccording to him, I apparently stole $300,000 from his family (pfft... I supported his dumb ass), was a prostitute specializing in Saudi gangbangs, and flew to Jordan for secret abortions, among many other schizophrenic accusations. That's zero percent true by the way.

At the risk of sounding like a silly, ungrateful child, let me explain.\n\nMy mom has a really short fuse, and blows up multiple times a day over the most petty stuff. It usually involves someone in the family not doing some household task exactly the way she would do it, like using the \"wrong\" towel to soak up a mess, but it can also be a driver who doesn't use a turn signal or some piece on the news. While such issues may seem too out of the ordinary, I cannot overstate how frequent and draining her little bouts of anger are, and as a naturally calm/non-confrontational guy, I usually prefer to avoid her altogether.\n\nWhen she's not screaming about something, she's complaining about it in a normal tone of voice. This is especially true when it comes to my and my sisters' lives. I'm a year away from graduating from a Big Ten university with a double bachelor's in economics and political science, but I have no idea what I want to do with my life. That being said, I feel like my areas of study are very versatile, with law, business consulting, economics, etc. all likely choices. I've done well in school and have a decent resume. However, my mother is convinced that I'm never going to find a decent job and will spend the rest of my life living in her basement. She says I should studying a STEM field because that's the \"only\" way to get a job these days, but obviously I decided against that path long ago. Every - and I mean *every* - conversation we have inevitably turns to jobs. I keep telling her I want to be successful and I'm going to figure it out, but she accuses me of being lazy, unmotivated, and not doing anything \"right\"- all untrue. She offers little advice, and endless criticism. \n\nAssistant: "}

After months of feeling trapped, controlled and under emotional abuse from her, I had to end it. I was 100% ready to end it after all the time I spent being unhappy with her. She however, was completely blindsided by it because she thought everything was fine and took it as a sudden thing. We had talked about my issues in the past but she never really took anything I said seriouslyrics and always assumed I was fine because I don't really show much emotion. \n\nMore toward the main point, I am feeling such a strange mix of things and I don't understand them. On one side, I feel free and relieved that I don't have to worry about being chronically stressed out anymore because of her. I feel like I'm my own person for the first time in YEARS. The other side of me keeps remembering the way she reacted when I broke up with her. It was the most horrible feeling thing I had ever done. Even though I don't love her anymore, watching her cry the way she did is almost haunting to think about. \n\nWhat I'm asking, is that are these feelings normal after a breakup like this? I've never broken up with someone before, and I don't know if the way I'm feeling is normal after this situation. \n\nAssistant: "}

So I, like many college students, work a shitty minimum wage job. But only during the winters, during the summertime (and most of the spring and fall) I work at a kids camp. So here's the problem, just recently we had somebody quit at the camp and they need me to work there more often. Anyways today was one of those days and it just got sprung on me that I had to come in on Thursday. so when I go in on Friday I give one of my managers a heads up that I wont be in the next day because I got called in to work my other job. As I was expecting she got a little pissy and asked me about 5 times if I was sure I couldn't make it in the next day by the end of my shift. At the end of my shift she asks me to call in if I still couldn't make it in. So, doing what I was told I call in and let them know I wouldn't be in an hour before my shift was supposed to start as is standard procedure. Of course at this point they start telling me that I could get fired because I'm refusing to work. I just listen to what she has to say, say okay, I'm sorry, and thank you. So during the inevitable talking to tomorrow I'm going to give them my two weeks because my other job, that I've been at for three years, needs me. Now the biggest problem here is that I have to work again next Saturday and if I tell them I have to work then I'm 90 percent sure I'll be fired. So I guess what I'm asking is if I get fired will that affect my future employment, (I don't have many things on my resume) or is it better to just quit on the spot or something... sorry for the lengthiness I've been up since 6 and its now almost midnight.. \n\nAssistant: "}

Yesterday we had a conversation, and I realized he's starting to not find positive feelings in talking to me, and we ultimately decided we need space. \n\nThe stress comes from us trying to date without being ready. Someday, we'll be ready. However, there is no longer any presumption that we \"might\" end up dating. We're just friends. Taking space. \n\nExcept, one day after saying we need space, he's initiating conversation with me, and we're talking like we always did as best friends. This doesn't seem like \"space\".\n\nHe's still the one that I want. But I think I'm going to stop chasing him for a while. I think I'm just going to commit to a very long term friendship with him. If I do this... Is it likely I'll get an opportunity in the VERY distant future to re-enter a romantic context with him? Just be friends for SO long, get to know each other SO well, that we'll just come together again despite the trainwreck of our first attempt and a conscious decision to step away from all that? I can't really \"wait\" for him, but should I consider him not out of the realm of possibilities yet? He has so much appeal to me. Despite all of the drama, I cannot imagine liking as much about someone else as I do him. \n\nAssistant: "}

Including the times we both toked and went to a rave together. Fast forward to now, a couple of days ago we both confessed our feelings for each other and subsequently started going out. Just now, however, my mother sat me down and told me she had discovered his tumblr and began lecturing me on the poor life choices I made. His tumblr is full of profanity and my mother now knows about all the things I did with him. She told me to stop talking to him, and never mention that she found out this information. Another note, I just graduated high school and even though we currently live 4 hours away, I am moving to a college that will make us only an hour away during the school year.\n\nI don't know if I should tell my boyfriend. I know my mother already HATES him, so even if we continue to date, I know I would never have my mothers approval.  I really am torn, I don't know what to do.

The site we met on is NOT a dating site, so it is not automatically assumed that either one of us is looking to date/hook up. We started chatting about our mutual shared interests, and soon began talking every day. He is smart, funny and good looking and pretty much great in every way. Pretty early on in our conversation he told me he has children, and then he later divulged he had a partner. This was not a problem for me as I liked talking to him, but recently things have begun developing further in a way that I am uncomfortable to go, as he has a partner. \n\nWe started IMing about a week ago, and a few days ago spoke using FaceTime. Nothing sexual/romantic was involved in either conversations, but it seems to be going that way as our conversations have taken on a rather flirty undertone. He has not outright propositioned me, or even said that he is interested in me that way, but he said that he really likes talking to me and has complimented my appearance in ways that make me think he is interested in me. Maybe it is presumptuous of me to think this, but what else could he possibly be after? Why else would an older man with children and a job be talking to a broke uni student 10 years his junior? I really like talking to him, and if he was not involved with someone else I would consider taking things further with him, but as it stands I do not want to be involved with a taken man in any capacity other than friendship. But what I don't understand is, if he wants to cheat on his partner with me, why would he tell me about her? Is he an idiot, or just supremely confident?\n\nSo, reddit, what should I do? Should I continue talking to him and pray he doesn't proposition me? Or tell him straight out I won't help him cheat on his wife?

I went out with my friends tonight (all male), however after this was planned my female friend (23/f) began attempting to rally myself and the guys I was with into meeting her for company at the local bar. I brought this up, but nobody was particularly interested, which was fine with me.\n\nIt came to the end of the night (around 12:30am) and I texted the female friend saying that I'm sorry but we just finished up. I'd just dropped my friends home so I was on my own. She then pushed for me to come join her at a bar to watch a sports game and have drinks.\n\nThis girl I've known for over a decade, and I consider her my best friend. However, I couldn't help but feel how this may be seen in the eyes of my SO of 1.5 years (24/F) - I know that if she went out with a male friend, alone, likely drinking, this late into the night that I'd be concerned.\n\nHence I made the call to just go home and said that I was tired to my friend. Although I feel like I'm doing right by my SO for sure, I worry that it's coming at the cost of doing things with my friend that there would be no issue with if my friend were a guy. Don't get me wrong, I feel happy about my decision and would have been uneasy with the alternative, however - is my emotional position correct? Should I feel the need to avoid such situations, or should I refuse to compromise a friendship due to the gender the friend may have? \n\nAssistant: "}

We danced and sang together for ages. Then I noticed we started to hold hands and she was standing close to me.

Then she gave me her number and told me to call her.

WARNING: slight wall of text. \n\nMy boyfriend moved out of town about three hours away from me about two months ago for work. Our relationship has been rocky ever since; doing the long distance thing is a lot harder than we had anticipated.\n\nYesterday during our nightly phone call he mentioned that he was going on a trip to see one of his friends that he hadn't seen in a little while. This trip involves about an eight hour car ride one way. I asked him who he was going with and he said it was with one of his female friends. This female friend, he says, is one of his best friends exes and the three of them had lived together before in the past. From what he says, she had sent him a facebook message asking if he wanted to come along on the trip to visit their mutual friend. \n\nI am not comfortable with this at all. My SO and I had talked about doing this trip together all summer; I definitely wanted to meet his old friend and make the trip down with him.  So for him to randomly go with another girl without inviting me is worrying me. I am dissapointed, feel left out, and am very jealous of this female friend of his.\n\nI expressed these things to him and he was not very understanding. I tried explaining the scenario to him: ''Let's say I went to.... say California for a few days with just one of my buddies.'' His response: ''I would break up with you if you went to California because you probably wouldn't come back.'' Not sure where his logic came from, I have talked about living in Cali for a little bit after school, but have never implied dropping everything and never coming back. I really wasn't sure what to take from that. \n\nI'm very confused and jealous, any advice on the situation would be appreciated. \n\nAssistant: "}

He's super inexperienced (I don't think he's even had a proper girlfriend before) so I don't know if he doesn't know that if he likes a girl, that they like to be acknowledged and to have a conversation or two every few days and to make plans and not be quite so last minute like they are with their buddies, or if he genuinely isn't interested like that. \n\nIt wouldn't be quite so bad if I didn't have other guys pursuing me and being a bit more aggressive about it.

I have always been wary of him because of their close relationship, and the fact that they previously had mutual feelings. \nNow, my girlfriend has discovered and acknowledged the fact that he still has feelings for her (but he is also interested AND perusing other girls). She is close to him and does not want to cut him off because of that, which is understandable. However I am a paranoid person, and I fear that she is just holding onto him in case things don't work out with me, or is even talking to him simultaneously as if he were dating her. My relationship with her has been unstable at times, but it's undeniable that we have very strong feelings for each other. I don't want to force her to cut off this friend either, for fear that she will cut me off instead and take him. She lives an hour away from me, and ten minutes away from him, and they are planning to hang out at some point, she said an idea was an aquarium (this seems like quite a nice date spot in my opinion. She insists that I have nothing to worry about, and provided valid reasons in why she is not interested in this guy. Should I be this worried? There is evidence that supports him being respectful of our relationship, but also evidence that could suggest there are things going on behind my back. \n\nAssistant: "}

Is it an option in this scenario? \n\nPOST: I'm completely new to the term property lien. I've heard it around this subreddit many times though so I'm hoping someone can tell me if it is an option in this situation.\n\nI own a small trucking company in Los Angeles that hauls containers to and from the ports of LA/LB. Recently a major shipping company filed for bankruptcy and almost all of their containers are being rejected by the ports. Nobody wants the containers back at this time.\n\nI've had multiple containers that are either owned by them or leased to them stored at my facility for nearly a month now and I am being billed daily for using the chassis they are on.If I leave a container at their facility longer than they want I get charged upwards of $100/day. I usually charge my customers $100 a day for storage if they request it so can I turn around and bill this directly to the company that owns the container instead of my customer?\n\nA driver of mine suggested I put a lien on the containers I have to force the company to pay the charges I am accruing and if they fail to do so he said I would end up owning the container which would be nice but I see it as highly unlikely to happen.\n\nMy current bills for these containers is nearing $2,000 (just in chassis) which I have to pay to the chassis company to continue using their equipment. I'm not sure if the company that owns the container will be charging me per diem (about $100 or more per day until returned) but I probably won't pay that because I showed good will by trying to return them multiple times but was rejected. \n\nAssistant: "}

Here's what went down:\n\nMe and some friends went out to the bar in my hometown last weekend. I was relatively sober. Ran into a female friend from high school who I used to have quite the little crush on. Now, I hadn't really seen or talked to her for ~2 years, but from social media I knew that she had a boyfriend. \n\nAnyways, we start talking and it's very clear to me that she is more than a little inebriated. While I'm not the best interpreter of how drunk a girl is, it seemed to me that she still had a firm hold of all her faculties and was able to hold a solid conversation and she wasn't stumbling around everywhere. Now, very soon in the time I had been talking to her, she was all over me - getting real close to me and touching and flirting. According to my friends that I was with, it was blatantly clear that she was into me.\n\nI was skeptical, because I knew she had a boyfriend and she was also drunk. However, she started talking about how shitty her relationship is and how she used to have a crush on me in high school and a bunch of not subtle things like that. She then dragged me out onto the d-floor to dance. She was really getting into it, and I think she wanted me to kiss her, but I refrained because she was drunk and I wasn't. Eventually her friends (who were her ride home) came and told her that they were leaving, so she told me goodbye and hugged me. I told her to text me and she said that she would.\n\nShe still has not texted me. So how should I interpret this? Was she just drunk and lashing out at her boyfriend? Or was it a case of \"sober thoughts are drunk actions\" and she's actually interested in me? Any advice is appreciated! \n\nAssistant: "}

Everything is going great, and we're starting to plan for the future. What do we want out of our relationship, where is it going, what are our priorities, hopes, dreams, fears, etc. We are both big communicators and talk *everything* out, so I don't see any problems on that front. We've tackled and dealt with some big issues like children and careers, but there's one that's still somewhat outstanding.\n\nI'm Canadian and moved here to the UK in 2005 (currently we live in London). She was born and raised in London. We both know we want to travel a lot and possibly live and work abroad, but that at least for the moment, London is home.\n\nThe concern is our families. Both our parents are retired and in their mid-to-late 60s, and will probably need some support in the next few decades. And both our parents will want to spend tons of time with any grandchildren that appear on the scene. Taking care of her family is probably more important to her than I, but I also don't want to leave my folks in the lurch, nor deny them access to their future grandkids. She has no siblings, but a reasonably wide extended family across the UK with whom she's reasonably close (notably her aunt and uncle who are like second parents to her). I have one brother on the west coast of Canada (I'm from near Toronto so he's far from my parents as well), but a fairly small, independent and somewhat scattered extended family.\n\nSo the obvious solution would be to plan to live in the UK. I love my parents and we get on well, but we've lived apart for nine years and are pretty independent in our own way. But I do love my parents and don't want to deprive them either of their progeny or-later on-necessary support.\n\nI was wondering if any Redditors had faced similar dilemmas and how you handled it.

The last time this happened, I mentioned that I wish we could talk more often.  \n\nHis response was to agree, tell me that he misses talking to me, but only sometimes because he has to make sure I miss him more. \n\nTo me, this seems really immature and like he's trying to play those strategic waiting games with me. I'm his first girlfriend and I know from my past experience that withholding communication does not make a fun or healthy relationship. \n\nI tried to talk to him about this and got short responses. When I mentioned that it doesn't feel like we're in a relationship when we go weeks without sharing a single word, he simply said it sucked not seeing me in person and said nothing more. However, I don't like criticizing him because he normally tries really hard, his self-esteem is on the lower side, and this is his first time. I really like him and I hate not talking to him; I just have never felt so alone in a relationship before. \n\nHe's not like any other guy I've dated before. I have no idea how to handle the quiet and inexperienced type, and for some reason his feelings seem that much more delicate. Any advice is highly appreciated. \n\nAssistant: "}

However, recently I stumbled upon a female who seems to be very near what I would consider for a gf. The story is as follows. \n\nAt the bar with a bunch of friends and she was our waitress. Naturally I was already extremely attracted to her. Sometime around ten, after she got off, I went to thank her for the great service. I then said we wouldn't be back for a while as a few of us are flying out to San Francisco. To which she replied, she had been. Admittedly I am a sucker for a female that has traveled. Then we got to talking about trips we had taken, of which I rarely get to do. As it turns out she had traveled to Tanzania and stayed in the exact same spots I had. We discussed the things we did there and how much fun it was, equally we both had summited Mt. Kilimanjaro. Indeed I was ecstatic, having not met a single female who had done this in two years. So we ended up closing the bar down, too which my friends had already left. I tell her I am going to start my walk home, promptly she asks to give me a ride, I excepted. Haven't seen her since. Here's the dilemma, considering all the context of the conversation I would hands down take her out, but she subtly showed me a picture which indicated she had a boyfriend, then she put her phone away as if it was an accident. Once we got back to my place I found out she had to work at 10 and for a 13 hour shift. So I question why she would stay up all night with me and forgo sleep. Was it just good conversation or should I pursue this female, with the given context of a relationship? Not to mention she has been on my mind since the encounter. \n\nAssistant: "}

We have been together for one year.\n\nA few months ago I was snooping on his Facebook messages and saw he had messaged a girl from his work. It was a pretty casual, friendly conversation, with maybe some slight innocent flirting (he said to her at one point \"it's a bummer we don't work together more often!\" for example). She was also very beautiful, so I freaked out. I am beautiful too but I have low self-esteem, so I completely thought the worst, as in he contacted her because he was into her.\n\nSo I discussed it with him and apologized for snooping. He was very understanding and told me she was only 17, so he definitely didn't see her that way, and that it doesn't matter at all because he loves me and would never cheat on me or leave me for someone else. He said at that time he messaged her, she was having \"family drama\" and had been talking to him about it at work. He saw she was online and decided to see how she was doing and cheer her up.\n\nI guess my concern still is that is it normal for guys in relationships to talk to their attractive coworkers outside of work? I personally don't use instant messaging so I find it hard to relate. My boyfriend is an extremely friendly person, and I know for a fact he is friendly with everyone at work, so maybe he is just the same way online? I just can't seem to get passed how pretty she is and think he was messaging her because he wanted to talk to a pretty girl:( He had text messaged and talked to this other girl from his work in the past but I never batted an eye because she wasn't prettier than me in my opinion. The 17 year old on the other hand, is very pretty. I KNOW how petty and dumb this sounds. I'm actually working with a therapist to combat these thoughts.

He was morally against it, unlike myself. I never had any conflicting emotions about the abortion and I didn't feel any regret afterwards. I considered all the emotions someone on the opposite coin would feel and I realized that came down to seeing life for not what it is. My ideological point of view is much different from his, and I didn't see the life as anything but for what it was. There is nothing to hold onto from our imaginations of the baby, and it's possibilities are just concoctions of dreams.

I figured some insight from this community would be helpful \n\nPOST: We broke up because I let things grow dull and I didn't support her passions. We fell into routine to much and things got boring. I did not set up fun new things for us to do to keep things interesting. The other reason being is that I did not support her passion of vegetarianism. When it first started I figured it was just kinda of a faze and teased her about it. The teasing continued to rise as her interest in vegetarianism rose to. It got to the point where we would have stupid arguments every couple of days about food. These arguments never got escalated but I am sure I got on her nerves enough. It has been a little over a month since the breakup and I consider myself stable emotionally and I have let the relationship go. I know that our old relationship is never coming back and I do not want it to. I want to start something new where we have both learned from the issues of the past. Yesterday we went out to eat together and she said she was really happy that she came and that she had a good time. Today we went to a Farmers market and everything went well. Here is the real kicker she is moving about an hour away for college in 2 days. This will complicate things for me but I know it will be worth it. I don't want to \"win her back\" or just have some sort of hookup because my ego was hurt. I really want to start a new long lasting relationship with her. Sadly it seems I learn best from hands on experience :( \n\nAssistant: "}

After filling out all my paper work I realized I filled out a previous employer verification ect. Well, I am starting to stress a little. I feel I have done a good job.

Lastly, I make deliveries (even though when I started I was told all i needed to do was X and Y, not Z. Z being deliveries) whenever I'm asked to. Its a family run business and I do my best to be flexible with their schedules. What I'm most scared about is they are going to say I'm a terrible worker since I'm their only employee and they would want to keep me. My question is I assume the phone call to my previous employer is important, but could it jeopardize my chance of getting hired? I was hired through mainly good word, I don't want to soil my buddies reputation, and most importantly I need the money for gas that my job provides to get to and from school. \n    **Edit**: \n\nAssistant: "}

Whats worse, is the company Christmas party has put them up in one of the most lavish hotels in the country, 100 miles away from where we live, overnight with free accomodation........IN SHARED ROOMS.

Initially individual buildings were emptied as threats were found written in bathroom stalls.  About four days ago the threats began to arrive by email via anonymous remailers.  That is also when multiple buildings began being threatened at once as well as when some of our dorms were first targeted.\n\nA fairly up to date list of threats, times, and targets is at [this link.](\n\nThe most recent article posted online with additional info is [here.](\n\nOur campus police are working with the FBI, local law enforcement, US DOJ, and regional Joint Terrorism Task Force are all working on the case and we must have every bomb sniffing dog for 250 miles on call - those dogs are champs!\n\nA student has started a blog to collect information in one spot [here.]  I don't post that though as anything more than a place to find info on when and where each of the threats are, and don't vouch for any of the analysis posted there.  The posts are only covering publicly released information and so are necessarily incomplete.\n\n**QUESTIONS**\n\nI'm not expecting any of you to come up with a solution.  Rather, I'm curious if anyone has stories of similar experiences or knows of other things we might do here. \n\nIn particular, when the dorms were threatened the anxiety among our undergraduates notably elevated.  Rumors of similar threats being made at Virginia Tech before the shootings there have surfaced, but those of of more prone to actually use our google-fu than believe rumors have come up empty when trying to find information on this.  Are we missing something there?  \n\nRelated, do any of you know of instances where repeated threats were used to learn about the police response in advance of something more serious?\n\nThanks for reading and sharing any ideas you have.  Just had our first threats on a weekend earlier this evening and less than an hour after those cleared, we had our first seven building at once threat which is being cleared as I write this. \n\nAssistant: "}

She fully expects me to propose and marry her (soon/now). I don't feel ready for that. Instead the thoughts of it make me feel very uneasy. We have issues to resolve. In my mind, things need to be running smoothly before you start a life-long union. She disagrees and argues that it is it not worth any effort or time on her side if I won't commit to unconditionally before trying to trying to fix things.\n\nThe current situation is: I got my way because I was ready to let things break and end. She gave up, and I got my way for now and didn't propose despite the length of the relationship.\n\nUnderstandably, it weights on the relationship. I can't explain my resistance. I can't explain my willingness to let things slip and end. I do not think I was fully aware of the events unfolding and the likelihood of a breakup happening.\n\nMy attempts to understand the situation better fail. And they make me question my desire to hold on to her.\nIt is not true that I cannot imagine a life without her. It is true that I would miss her a lot. I would feel very bad if we broke up. She put a lot of trust in me, and I would betray that. But I can also imagine us work out. It just seems I have the wrong motivation: Everything is fine, therefore it can go on. Shouldn't it be: \"I cannot live without her!\"?\n\nI know you cannot tell me what to do. What questions can I ask myself to sort it out in my head? \n\nAssistant: "}

I haven't seen his girlfriend since school let out which again isn't unusual as we aren't very close. I had hungout with my bestfriend a few times and he never mentioned the pregnancy and I never cared to ask.\n\nWell a few weeks ago I ran into a mutual friend at a local restaurant and she told me that my best friend's mother had ran into her earlier and informed her of the pregnancy.

My parents business is valued in the millions, and I currently run their business while they are semi-retired.  I earn 6-figures and could possibly be at 7-figures before my own retirement.\n\nWhen I date women, at first I downplay my life and assets.  Working for some corporate office job, sometimes giving myself a slight title such as office manager, or sales lead is what I tell them.  Typically I brush off or avoid questions or information involving my profession.\n\nI've been in 2 relationships that lasted 3+ years, and coincidentally they were woman from wealth themselves.  So this wasn't an issue in the past.  Now I'm out dating, I'm just an average Joe (despite what some might consider a humble brag above its just information relating to my situation), dressing and living modestly.  I mostly save my money and have a small house and drive a 2010 pickup.  Don't know a thing about designer clothes or caviar.  I have blue and white collar friends who all earn around the national average in their demographic.  Yes I usually pick up the bar tab, but not always. \n\nAnyway, I've been dating girls recently I meet online.  That section on eharmony where it says \"Income\" is what I left blank.  Not trying to attract the wrong type of lady.\n\nThe \"gold-digging\" issue is not the only problem.  By eventually telling them I am employed by my parents, it makes it seem like I've accomplished nothing in life.  Some may even express that opinion here on reddit.

I gave my work one weeks notice and my last day is tomorrow. However I just went into the office where I got the job and my (soon to be) boss hadn't realized that I have student loans not grants and they only hire people who have grants. He said that he would contact his boss and see if I can be employed with them through a contract which he said is likely but will let me know soon. \n\nSo I am kind of freaking out right now.

We've been together about a month. She's awesome, we get a long really well and see eye to eye on just about every major issue like sex, religion, politics, social situations etc. She's never given me a reason not trust her, on the contrary she's given me just about every reason to trust her. \n\nBasically the problem is that I have been cheated on or left in every previous relationship I've had before her. It's created a lot of trust issues, issues that I am trying to recognize as they come up and dismiss because she is not one of my exes and a different person. She and I have talked extensively about this because she has some of the same issues that I have. We keep the lines of communication open, tell each other when potential issues may be coming down the pike and resolve them as quickly as possible. She really is amazing, and I don't want this one to fall into the same problems my past relationships have. \n\nSo, my question I guess is what can I do to alleviate my over worked brain? Is this something that will go away as time goes on? (I have been single for the past three years, kinda got used to it) Anything you can provide would be awesome because like I said, I really, REALLY, like this girl. \n\nAssistant: "}

Anyone else have a good last day of work story? \n\nPOST: On the subject of Retirony, I was just wondering who else felt fate give them last licks on their way out of a job.  \n\nSo I've been a dishwasher and janitor at this restaurant/bar all summer.  Today was my last night because tomorrow morning I'm going back to school.  I got to work and went to go pee, and a man is sitting at the sink in the bathroom, puking, drunk, with two fingers up his nostrils, which are bleeding like a faucet.  Turns out, as he explained to me, he had egged the cooks on, trying to get them to make him super hot wings, and kept sending them back for not being hot enough.  So he finally gets acceptable wings, and 15 minutes later, this 280 pound, 45 year old jerk is bleeding out of his face and vomiting hot sauce and chicken into the sink.  He is now using one hand to stop his nose from bleeding, and the other to grab chicken vomit bits in the sink and throw them in the trash can, which he is mostly missing.  I get him a glass of ice water and tell him he can leave.  Now I'm gloved up, pouring bleach on *everythingggg* and mopping the floor, and of course scooping his chicken out of the sink.  When I was done cleaning, I noticed my arms were burning.  It occurred to me what this was, it's the hot sauce, which has already been digested once.  No matter how much I wash my arms with soap water, ice water, anything I can find, it wont come off.  So I just know there's vomit on me.  Happy ending though: My boss threw me a 50 at the end of the night. \n\nAssistant: "}

Things have been crazzzyyy busy and I had to step away for awhile, but I didn't stop losing  it while I was away!\n\nSo, like the title says, I started at 218, right after my youngest was born. I was miserable, my relationship was suffering(mostly because I hated myself), and I had no energy to play with my kids, not to mention feeling like a terrible role model for them. So I decided to do something about it. First it was weight watchers, and then I added in couch to 5k. That lost me the first 30 or so lbs. When I stalled from there I switched to calorie counting and using generic kick boxing videos, and lost about 30 more. I've lost the most recent 15 while continuing to count calories (yay MFP!) and using beachbody workouts(did 21 day fix, currently using and loving PiYo).  I started out in a size 20ish(I wore maternity pants for a long while to avoiding buying such big pants =( ) and I recently fit into my size 6's (see recent progress pic!) I still want to lose about 15 more to get into at normal BMI at least, and Im hoping to be there before the end of the year. After that I guess Ill just know when Im happy/done. \n\nThe biggest change? My confidence. I don't hate myself anymore. Sure, I dislike the extra skin and the bit of extra fat I have left to lose, but its not like before. I had no direction, all I did was eat and sleep and watch tv. Thats no way to live. Going on this journey made me realize how important it is to take care of yourself if you want to live a full life, so I decided to enroll in my local college to work toward becoming a registered dietitian. I want to help people who are stuck where I used to be, help them find not only health but also find themselves again.\n\nSorry for the long rant! \n\nAssistant: "}

Seriously, I think I'm pretty much the oldest virgin I know. I've had chances before to lose my virginity, but a rather conservative upbringing has held me back, thinking that it's more important to find the 'right person'. A recent discovery that my best friend had lost hers has pushed me over the edge. Now, it's 4 am in the morning, and all I can think about is how pathetic it is that I am the only virgin amongst all my friends.\n\nI am currently dating a really great guy. We've been seeing each other for an entire semester and unlike previous guys I've been with, he never pushes for anything on the intimate stuff. Despite appearances, he's a lot more sensitive and thoughtful than I originally expected, which is great, except we are going SUPER slow in the bedroom. Took him a month to take my bra off, and I initiate most of the 'moving forward', which is weird because he's had more relationships than I did and was very much sexually active with his latest ex. So I guess the most logical explanation is that he just wants to make sure that I am emotionally ready since I am the virgin.\n\nSo yea, I did make an attempt. I am rather shy at it, and this took a lot of courage to start. We were both completely naked, and I whisper to him \"do you have a condom?\" His response \"Gave my last one away to my friend weeks ago.\" Which is fine, except that was a few days ago and I still don't see any sign of a condom anywhere.\nSo guys, what do I do? I don't wanna be too forward and get a condom myself or anything because that might make the whole 'not want to be a virgin' thing too obvious, and I also don't want to appear to be too desperate (even though I am FRICKING desperate).\n\nIs there a sly way I can talk to him about this without dumping the whole desperate thing in front of him?

So far I love it here - weather's amazing, I love the city - but I am starting to dislike how much Americans seem to hug.

I've never met anyone I've been more compatible with - except for one aspect - sex. Initially we lived in different cities and only saw each other on weekends. So we'd have sex once a week. He said he wasn't into sexting or sharing pictures online because it was too impersonal (which I didn't agree with but I accepted that as a reasonable preference).\n\nAfter the first couple of months of dating he just started rejecting me through body language and some weekends we wouldn't have sex. We talked about it and he'd say things like \"I feel like that part of me is broken from last relationships\" or \"This is just how I've always been\".\n\nAnother detail is that he watches porn a decent amount. He has porn on his phone and he doesn't even try to clear the bookmarks or cookies from our laptop browser. I've brought that up too, saying I totally have nothing against porn but it's replacing me. It also really hurts my self esteem because he has one fetish - obscenely large tits. I'm very average size, maybe even on the smaller side. He says maybe he's addicted to porn and he wants to get better and maybe he should get help. But it's been over 6 months of him saying this with no change.\n\nWe've had sex maybe 3-4 times in 3 months living together and I try to ask him if there's anything causing this. Is it me? No. Are you not attracted to me? I'm so attracted to you! Is there something I'm doing that makes you uncomfortable? No, not at all. Do you feel ashamed after or dirty? No, I feel great and close to you.\n\nI've done nothing but try to accommodate him and to try to create positive and open sexual experiences and trust.

I am 23 years old, 174cm tall (just shy of 5'8\"), and i weigh 95kg (209lbs).\n\nI have always thought of myself as chubby, I wasn't deluded into thinking that i was healthy or anything, but after spending a bunch of time on reddit and talking to people that I know (doctor not inclusive) I realised that I am obese. \n\nFor almost 12 months I was doing really well. I had cut out most soft drinks and junk food from my diet,  I was going to the gym every day before work, and i managed to lose 20kg total and i was starting to feel great about myself. The problem started when for some reason after doing 30 minutes on the treadmill and 20 minutes of varied cycling on the stationary bike my back was in excruciating pain. As it turns out the 2 lowest vertebrae above my tailbone have no gap in between them and they have no cartilage either, which means bone grindy pain goodness. So I stopped working out.\n\nThen I transferred to a busier store at work. I had to take on a fuckton more responsibility so I was working so many extra hours. (Contracted for 38, regularly doing 46 or more with no overtime pay, hooray salary) so by the time I got home i was far too lazy to make dinner. So i bought cheap easy takeout food.\n\nWhen things calmed down in February this year I realised that I hadn't been to the gym in 6 months. I was drinking 2 473ml cans of Red Bull a day, eating probably in excess of 3500 kcal in crap food (little to no vegetables, high sugar, and high carbs) and the 20kg i worked so hard to lose was back on again.\n\nSo here I am, fat and unhappy that I now have trouble walking up the 2 flights of stairs to my unit, and looking for help on reddit. \n\nAssistant: "}

My dad was out walking his Siberian Huskies, all on leashes and on the dirt road, when a neighbor's smaller dogs rush the huskies and attack the group, including my dad (who has bruises and small dog bite marks from it). During the scuffle, my dad manages to free the main attacking small dog from one of the husky's mouth, who then immediately charges back at the husky. On the second go, the husky inflicted enough fatal damage before my dad could get them separated again.\n\nNow, I get that the owners of the now-deceased little dog are obviously heart-broken, but they've now filed a complaint with animal control that the husky is dangerous. And apparently in Oregon law, the fact that the owner's neglect (letting their dogs run freely through the neighborhood without leashes) and the small dog being the aggressor is irrelevant. So now my parents are being fined hundreds of dollars and the dog will be labelled dangerous, which would cause the dog to be put down if anything happens again.\n\nWhat transpired is obviously a tragedy, but I fail to see why my parents and their dog are being punished for being attacked and the husky defending her pack. We are all at a loss as to what (if anything) they should have done differently to prevent this, and this seems like they're being punished without having done anything wrong. So owners of big dogs beware; your dog defending itself from others may cost you. \n\nAssistant: "}

She friend-zoned me, for lack of a better word, and to this day we still remain very good friends.\n\nI was an absolute wreck for several months following Girl A's rejection, and I was working towards reconciling with her in hopes of giving it another shot. Then Girl B [18 F] started talking to me and was apparently interested in me. I was conflicted at first because I still had strong feelings for Girl A and wasn't quite ready to move on. However, curiosity got the best of me, as I had never dated a girl before, and all my friends were telling me that it'd be a good opportunity to \"experiment\" and \"help me sort my feelings out\". Things just kind of happened between me and Girl B without me even trying, and before I knew it, we were officially a thing. It moved a little too fast for my liking, but I guess I'm at fault for not doing anything about it.\n\nBut it's been over a month and the feelings for my former crush still persist. It's to the point where I'd rather spend time with her (as friends) than with my actual girlfriend. Now don't get me wrong, I do love my current girlfriend, and I'd be perfectly happy with her if it weren't for these extraneous feelings constantly nagging me. I suppose I could just give it a little more time in hopes that the former feelings will fade, but at the same time, I feel that it's not fair to the girl I'm currently with. On the other hand, it's not quite as easy as completely cutting Girl A out of my life, because as I said, we are still very good friends.

I meet a lot of great people socially, I do get asked out on a regular basis, and I've had great dates and short term relationships, but as soon as the conversation turns to \"so what do you do?\" things tend to stall. I've flat out had men tell me they can't/won't be with someone who makes more than them.

It is pretty low key and more of a group of friends than an organization.\n\nSo I have been to these events before and it is typically the same people in attendance.  This particular time, however, a new girl showed up who had just joined.  I found her very cute and it was my intention to speak with her and get her number before the night ended.  But being a new member, she spent most of her evening going around introducing herself to be polite.  I was only able to converse with her for a short while, and I wasn't able to fit in anything to gauge interest.  It was a 'Hi I am so-and-so, I moved from ____, I work in _____, and it is nice to meet you' type of conversation.\n\nThis bring me to my question.  The only way for me to contact her at this point in time is through her profile on the organizations website.

Now, very soon in the time I had been talking to her, she was all over me - getting real close to me and touching and flirting. According to my friends that I was with, it was blatantly clear that she was into me.\n\nI was skeptical, because I knew she had a boyfriend and she was also drunk. However, she started talking about how shitty her relationship is and how she used to have a crush on me in high school and a bunch of not subtle things like that. She then dragged me out onto the d-floor to dance. She was really getting into it, and I think she wanted me to kiss her, but I refrained because she was drunk and I wasn't. Eventually her friends (who were her ride home) came and told her that they were leaving, so she told me goodbye and hugged me. I told her to text me and she said that she would.\n\nShe still has not texted me. So how should I interpret this? Was she just drunk and lashing out at her boyfriend? Or was it a case of \"sober thoughts are drunk actions\" and she's actually interested in me? Any advice is appreciated! \n\nAssistant: "}

I've given it a lot of thought, but all I end up at is, \"I want to be with him.\" I don't want to be 'that girl'.

How do we talk about this? \n\nPOST: We've been dating long distance for six months, talking all the time but only seeing each other every couple weeks (she's in NYC I'm in DC). She is totally committed to the relationship and sees the next year, when we'll have to continue distance dating (grad school for her, work for me), as a bump in the road to our eventually relocating to be closer. \n\nFirst of all, I'm not sure I'm up for that, and I've let her know (trying to be as honest and open as possible) just because I've spent significant time in long distance relationships that haven't worked out before (that's not the case for her). It's been a long time since I've had a steady local girlfriend and that's what I think I want deep down. Like I said, we've talked about this but decided to keep going until one or the other of us feels like we can't. \n\nThe real problem is that my feelings for her are not as strong as I would hope they'd be. I know there's no objective scale, but between what I want from a relationship and what I think I ought to be feeling at this point, I just don't feel like I'm where I should be. At the same time, she frequently expresses her strong feelings for me - telling me how excited she is about us and even on one occasion telling me she loves me - and I just don't feel the same way. \n\nI don't know if it's a hangover from my last relationship or that the distance has prevented me from developing stronger feelings, but in the interest of fairness and openness, I feel like at some point I may want to try and tell her this. I can't tell if I just haven't gotten there yet or if I never will, but I've been on the other end of such asymmetrical feelings before and it didn't end well for me so I'd really like to do whatever is right by her. \n\nDoes anyone have experience with similar situations and/or advice on how to address the issue? \n\nAssistant: "}

I hope I'm not too late as I have taken action to try to get my job back but to no avail; I hope it didn't mess up my chances at litigation.\n\n   I'm 21 years old and I worked for a prominent hospital system in South Florida for 1 1/2 years and last November I was wrongfully terminated. Knowing it was a wrongful termination I fought back, won my unemployment case and was even exonerated, having the termination reversed (meaning I quit instead of taking it lying down) and I was nothing short of promised my job back. Now it's 8 months later and I'm about 99% sure that the emails I send to the HR director and forward to the CEO (at his request) are being ignored entirely. Everyone is playing \"oh we'll help you, you should be a shoo-in\" and then nothing happens as I stream in the applications for positions I am entirely qualified for. I have applied to 60 positions within the health system and at least 20 in the specific hospital form which I was terminated, to no avail. The manager who opted for my termination (I'm torn on whether he was \"out to get me\" or not) has since left the system. Not one person who caused me to be terminated was held accountable, not that it matters very much in this case, it just adds insult to injury.\n\n   So I am now heavily contemplating what doing what I should have 6 months ago (or more), to sue the hospital. So I ask you, Reddit, what is the best way to go about this? I do not have much money for a lawyer but the system I would be suing almost never (never) takes a case to court, in order to avoid the publicity; they would almost certainly settle, making it a win for the lawyer I would hire and myself. \n\n  Suggestions, feedback and what steps I should follow would be greatly appreciated! \n\nAssistant: "}

We've been living together for just over 7 months. Before we all moved in together my bf and my daughter got along well, but weren't close or anything. He was always around to see me, and she was simply there. Since we've moved in together though, they've become friends.\n\nIt's driving me up the wall. I'll just come out and say it; I'm jealous both that he is spending time with her, and that she seems to like him so easily. I had a lot of trouble raising her, and we've never had a good relationship. It's upsetting to see her take to him like a father she never had or something. I realize that is childish which is why I've been bottling it up, but I can't control my feelings on this anymore. \n\nThey spend a lot of time together, and though I don't think they actively exclude me, it often feels that way due to our differing work schedules. Too often I come home to find them hanging out or working on some project of his. She listens to him, like she never listened to me, and to be perfectly honest he has helped her improve herself (he helped her quit smoking), in ways that I wish I could. \n\nTo be clear, I don't think there's anything else going on. It annoys me that she listens to his advice. It annoys me that she does things for him (bring him things, cook/clean for him), but I don't think their relationship is anything but platonic. That's why I feel so conflicted about wanting to try and break it up.\n \nAm I justified at all in feeling this way? Part of me feels like a selfish ass for wanting to ruin a good thing for them. The selfish part of me feels like I deserve his time, not her. The darkest, smallest part of me is worried to be honest. I don't think anything is going on now but I know my daughter and I'm afraid that if she becomes attached she will start getting ideas. \n\nAssistant: "}

I've done my absolute best to not pressure her, and only bring it up every once in a while to test the proverbial waters.\n\nI love her very much and she seems like the perfect person for me.  She understands all of my idiosyncrasies and quirks and loves me for them. We often discuss our future together.  We talk about where we want to live, what kind of dog to get, and even what we might name our children.  We have spent 5 years getting to know just about everything about each other and making connections with each others' friends and family.\n\nI've always fantasized about being with other girls (I mean I was going through puberty during our early relationship and she is the only girl I've gotten to 2nd and 3rd base with).  Throughout our whole relationship I've watched porn on a daily basis (unbeknownst to her).  I find her moderately attractive.  She's not exactly a bombshell; neither am I.

She's always been a happy dog and has had no major behavior problems. She was always happy to meet people and would approach them first.\n\nAbout a month ago, our house was broken into. Our dog was in the house inside of her kennel while this happened. When we got home and found out, she was thankfully still there and unharmed. She just seemed happy to see us, like normal. We didn't really think much else about it affecting her at all.\n\nLast weekend we had a couple people over that none of us had ever met before. Normally, she would bark at them and then approach and sniff at them for a couple of minutes and then be fine with them. This time, though, she would not go anywhere near them. These people stayed the night at our house and she did not go within 5 feet of them the entire time. \n\nAnd then today, I took her with me to the hardware store to pick a few things up. She was completely fine on the ride over and as we were walking around the store, but anytime someone approached her to try and pet her or just anywhere near her, she would try and get as far away from them as possible (I had her on a leash, so she didn't have a chance to get very far). We're pretty sure this is related to the break-in at our house and we just don't know what to do to help her.\n\nWe've discussed a couple of ideas; one of them being taking her to some sort of trainer - although we're not sure where we can go or what we could even ask them to do. The other idea we have is possibly getting another dog - this is just something we talked about today, and again, we're not quite sure if this will help or hurt anything.\n\nReally I'm willing to try anything because she is such a great dog and I don't want this to be something that makes her into an unsociable dog for the rest of her life. \n\nAssistant: "}

For those unfamiliar with his book, the training plan consists of two scheduled workouts, labeled quality sessions each week, and the rest of the runs are  easy runs, until a target mileage for the week is met.. It allows me, with a job which includes a 45-minute commute twice daily, and a 21 month old daughter to have a somewhat flexible schedule, even when I run six days each week.\n\nThat flexibility, however, also presents some slight danger.  My current phase of the program called for a 66 km week last week - a goal which I met with relative ease.  However: Today was a public holiday in Norway (Pentecost), so I decided to switch my schedule around a bit, and run my Q1 session today instead of Wednesday.  \n\nThe first mile, across the doorstep was hard to do.  The warm-up was hard to do.  The first two minutes of my first 12-minute tempo-pace interval was hard.  After that, I'd run on autopilot (4:49/km average for the two repeats). That was actually the easiest bit of the workout.  After that, I was set to run one hour at easy pace.  That easy one hour was probably the hardest thing I've done in a while, which includes hard interval sessions, and my first 25km run last week.\n\nWhile I would certainly have expected the heat to account for some, it didn't explain it all. \n\nAlso, I couldn't quite figure out why the hell that was so hard. I ran 5x5min tempo pace last week, and mostly felt just good. That is, until I started looking at my Garmin Connect summary data: Total distance during the last seven days: 84.66 km.\n\nThat's 18 km more than my weekly schedule calls for! It's more than 10 km more than any single week in my training plan (I'll peak at 74). No wonder easy running was so hard today.\n\nThe upside to this is that I still have no pains that indicates an injury is coming on - I feel fine, but my legs and glutes feel like they have been _properly_ worked.   Depending on how I feel when I wake up tomorrow morning, I might actually take the day off instead of running. \n\nAssistant: "}

How do I approach her? \n\nPOST: My friend and I have been BFFs for 20 years, but the last few years we've been drifting apart, mostly because I live in Europe and she lives in our hometown.  I've lost most of my old friends because of lifestyle differences--we just have nothing in common anymore--but I really value this friend and want to keep her in my life because we've been through a lot together.  We've had several fights over the past few years but are trying to get back in touch. The problem is, she's super busy all the time and has consistently flaked on me when I'm in town, and then played the victim by saying I'm demanding time from her when I've been rearranging my schedule to suit her and in the past I have not been able to get even an hour coffee date in weeks or even months.  Now she wants to get back in touch and we're sort of negotiating the terms of our relationship, but I don't know how to say the things I need from her because in the past when I've laid it out as \"you need to make an effort too because I'm also busy, but I find time for you,\" she's thrown it back in my face as me demanding time from her and saying that I'm using it as a way to get attention. From my perspective it's just that I want to see everyone I care about because I don't know when I'll be able to come back.  We've had the same fight about 5 times now and nothing I say gets through, she just gets really defensive about having excuses for being busy, and then accuses me of calling her a bad friend.  She's also called me a snob for moving to Europe, so if we do hang out again I'm also not sure how to talk to her since all my stories would be set in Europe and about my friends there, who are mostly European.  I don't make a big deal about it, but it's hard not to give details about normal stories that people tell, or for example use words like place names that are in other languages.  Am I the problem?

So in July 2014 I was traveling through Santiago Chile and I met a girl via Badoo (Tinder). We met at a coffee shop near her house and 2 hours later we were in her bed. We had an amazing night and she messaged me the next night for the same. I told her from the start I was passing through and she seemed okay with this.\n\nWe had these 2 nights together and then I kept traveling through South America, but we continued to chat every day. Then she decided to buy a plane ticket and meet me in Sao Paulo Brazil for an 8 day \"honeymoon\". She rented us an apartment on AirBnB and we had an amazing week. At the end when she flew home she gave me a book of love notes she had been writing me, leading up to her visit to Brazil. I loved it and truly felt she loved me.\n\nFast forward 5 weeks and I was back in Canada when I decided to take a chance and fly back to Santiago to live with this girl. She welcomed me into her (our) apartment and we've had another amazing 3 months living together. Going on picnic's, playing games, having disagreements and making up, holidays, birthdays & I've met her family maybe 10 times and they seem to like me.\n\nI feel think I'm in love and see my future with this woman. We've discussed in detail our future, moving to Vancouver, having kids and a dog, decorating our house, etc. My question is this: I've known her for 6 months now (minus a week), is it too soon to ask her to marry me?

She constantly demands more and more, and I need to constantly keep compromising in order to make this relationship work.\n\nKey point: I have spoken to her about these things and she said that it's all because she feels that our relationship has been stagnating for the last 1-2 years. She would have expected that by know I would know she's the one and that I would make longer term commitments to her (to demonstrate my love and willingness etc.) such as proposing, buying a house etc. This makes her very insecure and that's why she acts like this. \nHOWEVER, the reason why I don't do these things is exactly because of the way she acts as described above, which makes me doubt that we're fully compatible and that she's the one.

I went a few times before choosing a dress but was having a hard time because I wanted a trumpet that flared at the mid thigh but am only 5’2. The bridal attendant handed me a dress that said should be perfect so I put it in, she clipped it, and it was great! I ordered it that night and was so excited. My dress arrived and this week went in for my try on which is when the disaster unfolded. The dress flared about three inches lower than when I tried it on and looked ridiculous on me. The way the bridal attendant clipped the sample made the flare considerably higher and I was told that is how it would flare. She insisted that did no wrong even though I have pictures in the sample showing the flare much higher. I asked to speak to the manager and they pretty much stalled for two hours. They made me try on my dress, then the sample, then my dress again, then another identical size 8 they had in the back (which apparently was not there three weeks ago when I ordered my dress but is there now?), my dress again, the sample again, and then someone else’s size 6 dress which they said was for a bride getting married next august so they could get her a new one. All while this was going on, an outside seamstress who they have there would not stop badgering me and trying to get me to do alterations with him.  I finally spoke to the owner and she refused to give me the deposit back despite the dress being a completely different shape from what I was told it would look like. She was incredibly rude, kept interrupting me, and was telling me the dress always flared at that place even though I had pictures from the day I ordered it! I left there crying and still owning a dress I that looks ridiculous on me with my wedding less than 5 months away. So to all my fellow NYC brides out there, be careful before getting a dress from RK Bridal! \n\nAssistant: "}

There was some sort of deal of buying one type of sub, get another free. He had a coupon too, but the clerk denied the coupon because there was an ambiguity with whether or not the coupon was allowed with other deals. At this time, the subs were already made, he was paying, but not for both. The customer decided to only pay for one, and asked for the other free since it was made and the clerk had to throw it away.

But if she had a boyfriend, wouldn't she had mentioned it to me before we drove? Also, when we were talking she mentioned to me that her friends were asking her how college was going and she told them \"nobody talks to me\" and some other stuff i don't remember, she followed that to ask me \"why did you talk to me?\" in a very serious voice, so i answered that i needed help to study (i didn't, i just used it as an excuse to talk to her) and then i said cause i thought she was very pretty.  and she sorta smiled, but more like she didn't hear the compliment. She also mentioned that she didn't do anything on the weekends, she didn't party, didn't smoke or drink, spent time with her parent and read in her free time; Which i don't consider boring, but does suggest that she isn't dating anyone atm.\n\nAnyways, if you need more info please comment I'm desperate, i honestly really wanna date this girl but don't wanna walk up to her and be like \"sorry i have a boyfriend\". \n\nAssistant: "}

I wasn't given the responsibility to put it away into the safe basically since I am still pretty new there.

Basically, they're gonna think I took it since I am technically the newest employee there, compared to the co-worker who has been working there for over a year.\n\nI am on good terms with everyone that works there, even the manager. I really don't think they would suspect that I took it. But since the call was made from the higher ups, there's not much they can do. The co-worker didn't get suspended either.

I was thinking of putting the job on my resume and saying I am still currently employed there so they don't contact them. Should I take legal action?? I feel lost.

When I try to ask her if it was anything I did, she just tells me it's nothing I'm doing and that she just needs time alone. It's been a while since we have had a real conversation about anything. If we do ever text all she says is \"okay\", \"yeah\" and \"wow\". But last week I was basically over her but then I saw my name with a heart next to it, in her phone. I don't know what to do about this anymore. It brought back all the feelings I had for her. She is a strong person and will go without talking to me and she wouldn't feel a thing. She also is very skeptical about letting guys into her life due to past boyfriends. This is basically killing me on the inside. I'm the type of person who cares and thinks to much about everything.

My dress arrived and this week went in for my try on which is when the disaster unfolded. The dress flared about three inches lower than when I tried it on and looked ridiculous on me. The way the bridal attendant clipped the sample made the flare considerably higher and I was told that is how it would flare. She insisted that did no wrong even though I have pictures in the sample showing the flare much higher. I asked to speak to the manager and they pretty much stalled for two hours. They made me try on my dress, then the sample, then my dress again, then another identical size 8 they had in the back (which apparently was not there three weeks ago when I ordered my dress but is there now?), my dress again, the sample again, and then someone else’s size 6 dress which they said was for a bride getting married next august so they could get her a new one. All while this was going on, an outside seamstress who they have there would not stop badgering me and trying to get me to do alterations with him.  I finally spoke to the owner and she refused to give me the deposit back despite the dress being a completely different shape from what I was told it would look like.

Looking back, I can see elements of potential emotional abuse in our relationship (it was never severely emotional abuse, just red flags, enough to make me wonder). The breakup was on good terms, we are both still friendly to each other, and 95% of the time can interact really well.\n\nMy problem now is, that sometimes he still sort of treats me the same way in front of other people, even though we are not dating. An example of this would be telling me to \"shut my mouth\" in an angry way if I say something that somehow made him angry. Or another time he just wouldn't let me speak, when I was trying to explain myself and essentially shut me down in front of my friends. These are really the only two instances of this happening, but I do not want to be treated like that. It is completely inappropriate and not fair to me. Also, I know that these instances are not rooted in any bitterness due to the breakup...it seems to be flashes of his way of dealing with things/treating people that I saw a bit of in our relationship.\n\nI'm not sure what to do if he does something like that again, because I don't want people to think we are slipping into some sort of \"couple mode\" if I challenge him and we have a little spat in front of people. But I do not want to put up with it, and if he is doing it in front of other people, I want to be able to stand up for myself. So I guess what I'm wondering is what is an appropriate response if he does something like that again? Say if he told me to shut my mouth, would it just be good to say \"please don't speak to me like that\"? The thing is, I really don't want to make it awkward for my friends who happen to be around at the time so maybe I should just let it pass in the moment and confront him about it later? \n\nAssistant: "}

Am I a rebound? \n\nPOST: I have been dating this girl for one month now and it has been perfect. We always have fun together, she seems super into me and often tells me how attracted she is to me. The sex is great and our chemistry is very strong. \n\nWith that said, I am concerned I am being used as a rebound, or as a temporary means to comfort her. She ended her engagement a few months ago with her ex of 4 years (they were engaged for 1 year).\n\nHere's the first red flag I noticed: For the first 3 weeks of dating her, she never told me she was engaged to this guy, she only referred to him as her \"ex boyfriend\". I didn't find out they were engaged until I looked at her Facebook page and where she still has dozens of photos of them together and all her friends congratulating her on the engagement. I found this odd because she had talked about him alot but intentionally hid the fact that they were engaged, only ever referring to him as her \"ex boyfriend\". I asked her why she never told me and her response was that \"she didn't want to scare me away\". Her ex bought a dog with her, so they take turns sharing the dog for a week. So they are still in touch with each other and she still talks to his parents about logistical things as well. \n\nI have no problem with her talking to her ex fiance about logistics, because we aren't in an exclusive relationship. However, this girl keeps telling me how much she likes me, but when I asked her what she thought \"about us\" she sounded confused and responded \"well... I like hanging out with you\" which was strange considering how much she professes her feelings for me. I like this girl alot. My concern is that I'm a rebound and she will ditch me when she gets bored or finds someone better. Should I be concerned about anything here or am I overthinking? \n\nAssistant: "}

We have been together for about 7 years and have no interest in getting married or having children (well, I would like to have children eventually, but that is for another time).  My girlfriends best friend has a boy who is about 5 years old whose father isn't involved.  Because of this, I find myself doing \"dad\" things with him.  \n\nRecently I brought up going camping/fishing with my girlfriend while our friend was over and she mentioned that her son has not gone fishing and he would love it.  Of course I offered to bring them and this weekend we will be setting out for an overnight to an upstate river.\n\nThis past Saturday, my girlfriend and I purchased our first vehicle together.  A very nice vehicle.  The only reason we could afford said vehicle is due to the fact that my girlfriends parents offered to pay a large chunk of it, having recently sold their company (we're talking 8 figures).  We are both very proud of this new vehicle in all of its shiny, clean glory.\n\nToday while sitting on the couch talking about our new baby (the car), we had a sudden realization that our friends 5 year old son will be riding in the car with us for upwards of 2 to 2 1/2 hours this weekend.

Yes she is in university like I am but when I think about it I'm not sure what her hobbies are.

Hotel block dilemma... \n\nPOST: We're getting married in a college town with a popular football program so when we first started narrowing down dates for the wedding we avoided all home game weekends. However, eventually for a variety of reasons we ended up scheduling the wedding on the day of a non-conference home game. Our big concern with doing this was that we'd heard it was near impossible to get hotel blocks on those weekends. We talked to a few hotels before moving forward and found a couple that were willing to do blocks but said we'd have to wait until a closer to the wedding to sign contracts. It sounded like we could make it work so we went for it. \n\nNow I'm starting to contact those hotels again and they're still willing to do blocks but the prices are much higher than we anticipated and obviously I don't have much power to negotiate here because the hotels know they'll be able to book rooms given the football game that weekend. I'm definitely kicking myself for thinking the football weekend wedding would work out but what's done is done. The date is booked, deposits are down. I'm looking into getting a shuttle set up from hotels further out from the city proper that'll potentially be a little more modestly priced so I haven't written off all hope. \n\nUltimately the question I'm hoping some of you lovely people will weight in on is, if I can't secure a block at a price I think my guests would be comfortable with ($150-175 range), should I contract for the expensive block (quoted 1 bed $219-259, 2 bed $239-289, suites $309-319) or just recommend that guests book early anywhere they can find at a reasonable price? \n\nAssistant: "}

Anyways today was one of those days and it just got sprung on me that I had to come in on Thursday. so when I go in on Friday I give one of my managers a heads up that I wont be in the next day because I got called in to work my other job. As I was expecting she got a little pissy and asked me about 5 times if I was sure I couldn't make it in the next day by the end of my shift. At the end of my shift she asks me to call in if I still couldn't make it in. So, doing what I was told I call in and let them know I wouldn't be in an hour before my shift was supposed to start as is standard procedure.

Sweet to every dog she met, played nicely with all of them.\n\nWithin the first six months that we had her my parent's older cocker spaniel attacked our dog while she was sleeping during a visit to my parents' house, bit my dog, then myself and my dad when we tried to intervene. I was afraid that she would be traumatised by this, but she was still good with other dogs at this point.\n\nTwo-ish years ago one of my cousin's dogs charge her (not sure why) and they got into a pretty bad fight. Both dogs came away bleeding. After that was when she started having issues. If we met a dog on our walks that was quiet and ignored her, she was fine. But dogs that would bark or lunge at her would set her whining and pulling.\n\nShe escaped our backyard once when the gate was left open by accident, and she got into a fight with another off leash dog. We didn't see this happen, so we don't know what happened. Again, both dogs were bleeding. The neighbor's dog needed stitches (which we paid for). At this point I was deeply upset. Now we always double check the gate before she goes out. Kept her away from other dogs as much as possible when we weren't sure of them.

Before that, my car wouldn't shift from park to drive (automatic), which required a complete replacement of the shifter. Now, 1.5 years later, my car is completely un-drivable. It failed inspection in march and sat until this month when I THOUGHT I had enough money saved up to fix it. My airbag light is on, which to fix is $1600. And my power steering is all kinds of messed up, needing a new steering rack for $1100. This car is worth only $3,500 absolute max. My question is, how do I make the car manufacturer realize that these problems aren't normal and I shouldn't be responsible for them? Who can I talk to in order to get help? 1. My husband leaves for Germany tomorrow and I will be without reliable transportation for 3 weeks with 2 kids and 2. I don't have the money for these repairs. I need help! I've contacted everyone I could think of, but no one seems to care. Its been pretty much \"not my problem\" every time. \n\nAssistant: "}

However, one issue that keeps coming up is her cat.  She got him when he was pretty young, about 2 years ago.  When he was young, I got along fine with him, but as time has gone on, I've found myself disliking him.  He seems to relish in being generally destructive, loudly meowing at doors, and trying to bite or slash at my legs when I walk around the house.  When biting, he doesn't cause serious injury; sometimes he'll draw blood, but never enough to actually cause a real problem for me.  He also seems completely resistant to any kind of training or correction.  \n\nWhile I have nothing specifically against cats, I'm a dog person, which probably influences my negative feelings to some degree.  That said, sometimes the cat does do nice things like sit on my lap and purr, so I'm not really sure whether he actually hates me or he just changes his mind a lot.\n\nNormally, this remains a stable situation.  However, sometimes, I get so frustrated at him that I have angry outbursts.  While I've never actually hurt him (that's not really my goal), I've yelled nasty things at him, tossed him short distances from where I was sitting, and lightly push/kicked him when he was attacking my feet.  These incidents have really started to bother my GF, who has said that I really need to stop.\n\nI'm trying to figure out how I could best remedy the issue.  One thought I had was perhaps ignoring the cat altogether and leaving all cat related disciplinary action to my GF.  Another thought I had was trying to apply standard anger management techniques when I feel frustrated with him, to try and cool myself down a bit.  What do you all think?

The place that offers it seems pretty legit (apart from the fact that they don't pick up the phone and their voice mail is full). However, there's no precise information about how they work and what exactly they are good for. Most of the websites I found talk about lipolaser as a kind of plastic surgery that settles in definitely after 6 months. The offer is 5 sessions in MAX a year, so it sounds fishy. Apparently, many places do it for a couple times every 4-6 weeks (like laser hair removal). Does anyone know about that?\n\nAlso, I wonder how bad it hurts. It says that people only get local anaesthesia while they undergo the treatment. Does it hurt anyway? Does it hurt a lot when the anaesthesia wears off? Like, is it possible to walk back home after for example? How long does it hurt for? Is it really swollen and sore for 2-3 weeks like they say on many websites?\n\nLastly, who is it better for and does it scar? They keep saying, on the sites that I found, that the results depend on the age and the state of patient's skin, but they never say what's optimal. I'm 25 and probably don't NEED it, but my thighs are pretty big and have always made me self conscious. Don't mistake me, I would never get liposuccion or any other kind of plastic surgery (i feel good about myself in general, it's too expensive, and I don't want scars), but this seems pretty cheap and safe.\n\nAnyway, any advice, personal stories, friend of a friend stories, etc. will help me greatly!

I stop at Jack-in-a-Box for some dinner. My car is a 1996 Suzuki, the cupholder is a pop out thing that only hold the bottom of the cup.

I turn, and my coke spills into the passenger side. I take my eyes off the road and fumble with the cup. I look up and crash into those railroad signal things that lower when a train comes. I come out fine, airbags did the trick, seatbelt on, but the bar on the train thing comes loose and falls, and the thing is activated, blinking and sounding off, even though there's no train.\n\nSome guys that were passing by helped me out of my car and phoned the cops, and we wait in 23 degree weather. So, I do the paperwork, say what happened, and soon have to wait for the tow truck to get my car. Front is completely fucked, though everything else is fine, no broken windows or anything. So, I get my ticket, and get a ride home, after I'm informed that train activity has to stop until the railroad crossing sign is fixed. Damage to that wasn't bad just made it tilt, and loosed the bar. \n\nAssistant: "}

She had her baby at the beginning of this year, and has since been a SAHM.

I was planning on proposing to her in February 2011. But last January she just stopped talking to me. Not returning my phone calls, texts, and every time I went to her place she was never home. After a month went by I just accepted the fact that she dumped me and never gave me closure. It killed me, but I moved on. I really would have preferred a straight up break up than her leaving it open like that. I still don't know what went wrong. \n\nAfter that I dated on and off but nothing serious. I thought I was over it, but like I said I discovered her wedding video and it brought me to tears. She got married earlier this month. So in 11 months, she somehow found someone else, got engaged and got married. I started thinking how she was able to do this in such a small time frame and the only logical answer I had was that she was cheating on me way before she did what she did. It made me sick to the point where I actually started vomiting. I guess I'm happy for her, but still it made me depressed.\n\nSo Reddit, what I'm asking is is it normal to feel the way I feel?

She's had 3 long-term relationships prior to me, all of which ended very badly with her being cheated on.  On one of them, see walked in on the act.  One of the ex's was very manipulative and really broke down her self-worth and has caused her to have some trust issues.  He cheated on her with another guy, and multiple girls.  He was a chronic liar, and a very very good one.\n\nFast-forward to now.  We've just recently moved in together and have gotten over the \"getting to know you\" phase, which we both welcome and are very happy with each other.  We're \"settling down\", I guess you could say.  Some issues have started to surface, however, that worry me a little and I'd like to address them, but I don't know how.  She has admitted to me that she has an irrational fear of being cheated on, due to her past experiences.  We've talked about this in detail and cleared many things up, but the problem is very deep.  Simple situations like me staying up when she goes to bed brings out a fear in her that I'm talking to other girls online, or looking at porn and masturbating because she's not good enough.  Both of these are things that have actually happened to her with previous boyfriends, so I respect that she would have these fears.  I would just like to find a way to address the issue and help her realize that I'm not like any of her scumbug ex-boyfriends.  I would never cheat, I would never lie to her.  I really do love this person as much as it is possible to love another human being.  Is there anything I can do? \n\nAssistant: "}

I then shifted positions and saw movement in my peripheral- seeing that he was masturbating. I rolled onto my back and began to help him with my hands and he started to fondle my breasts. It later hit me that he had been masturbating without my knowledge while kissing me. I just feel like he was using my presence/body as something he is sexually attracted to in order to help him get off. He asked me if I wanted to interact with him sexually and I said no, and so he decided to masturbate- but then physically included me without my knowledge. \n\nAssistant: "}

How should I proceed? \n\nPOST: I'm sure many of you are familiar with Lulzsec and their exploits. I have recently been finding myself going through the archives of emails and passwords that they have made so public. In particular I have been looking for anything that might belong to a friend or family member, especially my parents who are fond of clicking every link they ever see. It occurred to me that it is far from just my friends and family who might benefit from knowing that they have had their sensitive information compromised. A lot of the victims here are probably just as clueless as my parents, don't keep up with technology and hacking news like I do, and probably have no clue their sensitive information is publicly available. I considered writing a script that would capture all of the email address in these assorted releases and send each one a friendly anonymous email informing them of their situation. I'm sure many people would change their passwords, change their emails, maybe take the opportunity to learn a little bit more about internet security. I'm sure many would also flip out. Nobody likes to receive an email from an anonymous stranger that essentially says \"I know your password.\" Even if I did write this bit of script, it would certainly be detected as spam, be dropped, and likely land me in hot water with my ISP. Very few people are in a situation where they have control over their own mail server and arrangements with their ISPs to expect large amounts of traffic from it. Essentially that's just major corporations with massive legitimate mailing lists. Is there anybody with the resources out there to accomplish this seemingly simple and helpful task? Anybody have any ideas about how I could go about it without invoking the wrath of my ISP or doing anything illegal? Is there somebody that has already done this? \n\nAssistant: "}

One night I was talking to him about why it hadn't worked out between him and my friend. We were both a bit drunk, and he admitted that it was because he fancied me but knew I wasn't big on the whole emotional attachment thing. Well, this threw me because I had been trying not to admit to myself that I liked J for a while - I'd been trying to keep it strictly sexual with him, nothing emotional because that's how people get hurt. I stupidly admitted this to him and he suggested that we become 'exclusive friends with benefits' - ie, we don't shag anyone else but each other.

I believe we are taking things way too fast and it is partly my fault.\n\nI do really like spending time with her and she's a lot of fun, but she seems to like me a lot more than I like her.  She is already asking me to commit to the relationship, keeps buying me gifts, and tries to contact me all the time.  \n\nBecause we are long distance, we have to see each other during the weekends.  I'm just not ready to completely give up every weekend to spend time with her as I still don't know her that well yet.  It would be one thing if she was local and we could see each other maybe once a week, but it's too much too soon for me right now.   \n\nI really do like the girl, but I feel like I need to break it off with her to be fair to both of us before we get too invested in the relationship.  She is coming off very clingy and is scaring me a bit. It is also causing me to lose attraction in her that I originally had when we first met.  \n\nShould I tell her we need to slow down or break it off completely?  I don't want to hurt her feelings, but I also want to be honest with her that she's taking things way too fast and I'm not ready for that.  I could use some advice on how to approach this conversation.\n\nThanks. \n\nAssistant: "}

Growing up, my sister and I were blamed for everything from my father's alcoholism to my parents wanting to divorce.  My mother is incredibly emotionally unstable, and is a pretty classic narcissist.  I was also always told that if I ever touched a woman, she would scream rape.  I know that that is a lie, I have been with women since, and still have yet to be charged, however...\n\nI don't really have any friends.  I've tried making friends, but it's usually just me going and saying to people, hey do you want to hang out, and they say no.  So I spend all my time by myself, which is just fine by me.  I'm going back to college in a few months after having dropped out several years ago in order to figure out what I want to do.  I have no reason the suspect that college will be any different.  When it comes to women, the more I read the news, the more I try to stay away from them, because I have it in the back of my mind that they are emotionally unstable, and I'm going to be the one on the news charged with rape.  It sucks, because there are certain things I would like in a relationship, someone to hold, someone to talk to, someone to help me, and I can help them.  I have some idea of what a healthy relationship is, I will just always sabotage myself long before I get anywhere near that.  I've been trying to come to terms with the fact that not only am I going to die alone, but also live my entire life alone, and that it's probably going to end with me sticking a gun in my mouth before I'm 40.  I face that everyday, and it's hard to deal with, but I keep my head up, and keep fighting through every single day.\n\nI don't know, that's my little rant. \n\nAssistant: "}

We used to post to r/gonewild a lot, both together and just as her. It never bothered me that she received messages and replied to them and flirted with other men because it was open and there was no deceit.\n\nI recently found out that she has been sending messages to some of her 'fans' from another Reddit account that I don't have access too (found out as she left it logged in on my iPad), specifically so I can't see the messages - she says that in her messages.\n\nThere is one person in particular who she talks to a lot, most days. As far as I saw there was nothing very sexual in her messages (just him complementing her on her r/gonewild posts), but they were very affectionate toward each other. He would say how he hoped they could be together one day, how much he misses her, she said that he's one of the few people that she feels she can talk to and feels comfortable with.\n\nFor full disclosure, we had a problem a few months back that I was chatting explicitly to other women via social media and it almost caused the end of our relationship. I'm not proud of it, and I'm doing everything I can to make it right.\n\nSo what do I do? I haven't confronted her as she's more than entitled to have a friend I don't know about and speak to them in confidence. Should I be worried? Maybe she's trying to get back at me?\n\nLet me know what you think. Thank you for reading. \n\nAssistant: "}

We're incompatible in how we communicate and socialize, and I wasn't fulfilling an intellectual need of his. Of course, I was devastated to hear this.

Perhaps posts such as this have been done in the past, but I thought this message could be helpful now.  I've noticed over the past few months a few posts dealing with eating disorders and diets.  Please, if you see a post from someone stating that they have a past or current history of an eating disorder, or notice eating disorder behaviors listed in their post, do not give diet advice!  The only advice that internet strangers should be giving regarding health conditions is to seek professional help :-).  Eating disorders are complex and notoriously hard to treat, they are life consuming, and have the highest mortality rate out of any mental health disorder.  Considering that the diet season is now in full swing, I imagine these posts may become more common.   And please, if you feel that you may have an eating disorder or a dysfunctional relationship with food seek professional help.  There are nutritionists, therapists, and physicians who specialize in eating disorders.  Eating disorders come in all shapes and sizes.  Just because you aren’t as thin as what we may stereotypically think a person with an eating disorder should look like, it doesn’t mean that you don’t need or deserve help!  If your relationship with food or your body cause you a considerable amount of stress, please heed this advice.

I become distant, giving vague answers, avoiding eye contact. I'ts not pretty, and I imagine they must take it personally.\n\nIt's even begun to manifest in just plain not liking touching people now. Shaking hands is fine, but I don't like hugging, or sitting too close to even people I know well.\n\nOf the three \"relationships\" I've been in, the girl had always asked me out, and I always endded it by, *ahem*, not talking to them and hoping the problem will fix itself.

You might not have heard of them but they are a HUGE company working in all sorts of sectors you never thought possible (including helping to privatise the UK justice system). It killed him every day he went, partly because the job was terrible, partly because it took him 3 hours round trip every day, partly because his life's ambition of having a well-paid office job and having money suddenly wasn't so appealing. \nAnyway, the only good thing he took away from this job was a crappy little mug that he cherished as some sort of metaphor for all the lessons he learnt that summer. Today, I broke that metaphor, and I was sorry, but sorry doesn't glue mugs back together.\nHe is a hard man to anger, but this was oddly too much. The only way he can be recompensed is for the mug to be replaced by a mug that is WAY better. As it is his 21st next month I can afford to spend a bit of money on it. It can be purely superficially way better (like, an electric mug?) or more abstractedly an improvement (e.g. the mug was used by Churchill at Yalta).\nPlease post your ideas....HERE *insert downward arrow \n\nAssistant: "}

This is long. \n\nPOST: Male miniature Schnauzer, 5 years and 3 months old. It started about a month ago. He started becoming very finicky with his food (blue buffalo grain free dry kibble); he started off by taking *forever* to eat it, then would flat out refuse to eat it unless I wetted it with some water, then refused that unless I added a little fish oil, then refused that unless I added a very light sprinkling of bacon bits. Then even that was it. So I bought a few varied cans of wet food last week. The first couple of times he ate absolutely everything in the bowl; I mixed his usual BB dry kibble with the wet, the first few days he ate it all and even licked the bowl. Then he started just eating the wet food, going as far as just standing there licking the kibbles until he got all traces of the wet food, but left the kibble untouched.\n\nToday, not ten minutes before posting this, he only ate about half of everything in the bowl, then walked away. I encouraged him to go back to finish eating. I bent down to shake the contents of the bowl around (that encourages him), and he bared his goddamn teeth at me. He hasn't done that in YEARS. I immediately took the food away, and sent him to his kennel for time out.\n\nHe has never been like this before. It's been over a month at this point, and I'm at my wits' end. What do I do from here? He's not sick, he is normally VERY well mannered, easy-going/laid back, affectionate, etc. This behaviour is highly unusual for him. There haven't been any changes to his environment, routine, or ours. The only change on his or our lives has been the weather. He's the only dog of the house, has never in his life had food aggression, nor has he had a problem with his food. \n\nAssistant: "}

I broke up with her a week before she left (not because she went to a study abroad trip but because she is a compulsive liar and cheated on me). We were together for 2 years and 1 month and she was my first girlfriend. We have been broken up for only 3 weeks, I upkept NC (strictly talking to her) for 2 weeks. \n\nWhen I saw the picture, it touched the surface on how perfect of a time she was having there. I had an almost new post-breakup rush from seeing it, sort of like the feeling I had when I broke up with her. The feeling of puking, my stomach churning, light-headedness. I can't have that anymore if I want to move on.\n\nI felt like I could handle her being my Facebook friend. But I could not. No contact is essential. I blocked her from Facebook, from Instagram, everything. I can't go through a rush like that again. \n\nEven though I broke up with her, I still love her. I still care about her. But it's still hard from this end, I had the best hopes and dreams for us. I obviously took grasp of reality and I realize she is not going to be in my future anymore, that I ended us for the best. She's much different than I am and she has different values in life than me. Oh, and she cheated and lied to me. That helps a lot. \n\nFor those who seek advice, comfort, and other things - life goes on. I've gone through a mental re-vamp myself these past 3 weeks and I've realized **time does not change us - only the realization and acceptance of the present changes can bring us happiness.** Also, love is not concentrated into one person and love is pretty much all around us. There are many and plenty of people out there that care about you. \n\nAssistant: "}

We both recently got out of a couple of long-term relationships (about 2 years each, both got out around 5-6 months ago). I've heard him bring up his ex a few times, and I've talked about mine with our friend group on a few occasions as well. Since we started out as friends, talking about these things didn't seem so taboo.\n\nI knew immediately that I was somewhat attracted to him, but since I was still pretty hung up on my ex, I didn't want to pursue it at all. I recall him telling me the same thing back when we were first becoming friends.\n\nThen about a month ago, we hooked up. No sex, but heavy making out/cuddling. We were drinking, but neither of us were anywhere near drunk. For a few weeks following this, we had some weird kind of cuddle-buddy thing going on. I know we probably should've, but we never talked about any of this.\n\nNow he's really all I can think about. I'm starting to develop real feelings for him. I've also noticed that I'm not thinking about my ex that much anymore nowadays. I haven;t stopped thinking of him completely, but it's drastically less than the beginning of the semester.\n\nThe problem is that over break, I've been feel ourselves drifting apart. I don't know if I'm just too attached to my phone or he prefers talking in person more or whatever (our primary form of communications since break started is text), but we talk less and less everyday. I'm afraid that I'm getting on his nerves.\n\nWe get back from break in a few weeks, so I can see if there's any drastic change in the way he interacts with me when we get back.\n\nMy question is: Is this something I should pursue? I think I would be up to make the first move if I can confirm that there is even some kind of hope that he'd say yes. However, we have such a good friendship, and I'm afraid of losing that.\n\nAlso, should I take the talking less over break thing personally? Or am I just over-thinking things? \n\nAssistant: "}

Long story short, I was hysterical because I thought he was just abruptly ending things, he was unemotional and just apologized.\n\nA few days later, we had a long talk and decided that we DID want to be together, but didn't want to jump right back into our relationship without solving some problems first. The major problem in our relationship is that he feels we don't talk about things couples should be talking about. I'm blaming it on my daddy issues. I've never had a stable male figure in my life, and i bottle my emotions instead of talking about them, whereas my boyfriend is pretty big on communication.\n\nWe have come to an agreement, that we think we need to focus on talking/communicating, rather than the physical aspect of our relationship. I was okay with is until I realized that he didn't want to be together right now. He says he needs space (which I respect, and am currently staying with my mother to give that to him). He told me that he feels I depend too much on him, but when I tried to explain to him that I've never had a positive male figure in my life, and then he came along, that I got attached and may come off as suffocating sometimes. I feel that I wasn't getting through to him and he doesn't understand that part. \n\nHe has made it very clear that he wants to just be friends right now so that we can focus on our common interests and communication. I understand where he is coming from, but I feel that we can't work on communication in our relationship, if we are not in a relationship. We have agreed that we will not be actively seeking other people (i.e talking to/dating others).

During that tinge, I found it that he actually never thought we would last too long, because he does not usually date too long term.

Last night me and girlfriend were talking to each other and somehow something about her ex-boyfriend came up. Now being a typical friday night I was drunk and stuff and being the stupid piece of shit that I am, I coaxed her into telling me about her past sex life. Now I knew right from the beginning that this was bad idea but you know how that is right? It's one of those things that you don't want to know but you still want to know.\nSo she ends up telling me how she was a really bad bitchy kind of girl back in high school. She used to go out partying regularly with friends and cousins and her boyfriends. She used to get pissed drunk. So far so good. I don't have any issues with her drinking. Then she tells me that dated some two guy friends before her ex. Now this was some new news.But still ok. No problem with that too. Then she tells me she and her boyfriend had been till 3rd base and she was still a virgin which I really doubt now. \nHere comes the tricky part. She told me that when she was in her mid-teens, she went to a nightclub and got picked up by some stranger guy from the bar. They went to some hotel but did not fuck. I know this sounds weird. She said their conscience kicked in and they dressed up and left without fucking. Now mind you this was when she was already in a commited relationship with her ex. And you know what they say that 'once a cheater always a cheater'. \nI feel like she's lying to me and has slept with a lot of guys. So people tell me how to tackle this emotional trauma caused by the candid confession session last night. Has any of you been there? How do you cope up with the fact that your love was already banged by a lot of guys before? \n\nAssistant: "}

Here's what went down:\n\nMe and some friends went out to the bar in my hometown last weekend. I was relatively sober. Ran into a female friend from high school who I used to have quite the little crush on. Now, I hadn't really seen or talked to her for ~2 years, but from social media I knew that she had a boyfriend. \n\nAnyways, we start talking and it's very clear to me that she is more than a little inebriated. While I'm not the best interpreter of how drunk a girl is, it seemed to me that she still had a firm hold of all her faculties and was able to hold a solid conversation and she wasn't stumbling around everywhere. Now, very soon in the time I had been talking to her, she was all over me - getting real close to me and touching and flirting. According to my friends that I was with, it was blatantly clear that she was into me.\n\nI was skeptical, because I knew she had a boyfriend and she was also drunk. However, she started talking about how shitty her relationship is and how she used to have a crush on me in high school and a bunch of not subtle things like that. She then dragged me out onto the d-floor to dance. She was really getting into it, and I think she wanted me to kiss her, but I refrained because she was drunk and I wasn't. Eventually her friends (who were her ride home) came and told her that they were leaving, so she told me goodbye and hugged me. I told her to text me and she said that she would.\n\nShe still has not texted me. So how should I interpret this? Was she just drunk and lashing out at her boyfriend? Or was it a case of \"sober thoughts are drunk actions\" and she's actually interested in me? Any advice is appreciated! \n\nAssistant: "}

How about yours?\"\n* Her: \"Haha I know, that would have been fun! One of these days we need to get together :) it was pretty chill, went down to [local park]\"\n* Him: \"Yeah it would have! Yeah we do, we need to soon. I keep fantasizing about us playing again :P\" \n\nI've had suspicions that she's cheated on me in the past and have discovered messages between her and someone else in the past that were borderline, and we almost broke up over those (the text mentioned them getting together and drinking in a hot tub recently, and I had no idea who the guy was) but I let her have the benefit of the doubt and moved past it. Now my heart's racing from the prospect that she's potentially been seeing multiple people without my knowledge or consent while we have been dating. \n\nAssistant: "}

When we first moved in landlord and I could talk easily and she even asked me to babysit her unborn son (currently 4 months). We were on really good terms until about a month ago. \n\nIt was a comfortable day and my daughter (2 years) and I had just gotten back from the grocery store. I ran inside to put money on the laundry card and the landlord joked about my husband taking care of our daughter. I should have just laughed it off but I mentioned that I had left her in the car for a moment. At the time I didn't think anything of it, did what I had to do, and ran back outside. I was inside for less than 2 minutes, the same song was playing on the radio when I returned to my car. \n\nI have only spoken to her twice since then, however both times that I have, she won't look me in the eye, she's short with me, and seems to have a chip on her shoulder. Maybe I should have mentioned that my daughter had the radio, AC, and the doors were locked but I honestly I didn't think it was a big deal or that it was particularly her business.\n\nThis probably shouldn't worry me, however I am concerned it may affect our chances of leasing for another year. Or, even worse, that she may try to report me to CPS. She's a little bit out there; doesn't believe in vaccines or abortion, both of which I have very strong opposing position on. However I have never said anything contrary to her opinion. Mainly because of this very issue.\n\nI'm sure that I have not given her any other reason to have an issue with me other than this. Its kind of unprofessional for her act like this with a renter at all. It almost seems like I said something to offend her personally but I am not sure what else it could be. \n\nSo what I am asking is what is the best way for me to inquire about her problem with me without compromising our position to least another year or getting too personal.

I have a question I was hoping you could help me out with.  Let me start by explaining the situation.\n\nI am 25 years old and my girlfriend is 26 years old.  We have been together for about 7 years and have no interest in getting married or having children (well, I would like to have children eventually, but that is for another time).  My girlfriends best friend has a boy who is about 5 years old whose father isn't involved.  Because of this, I find myself doing \"dad\" things with him.  \n\nRecently I brought up going camping/fishing with my girlfriend while our friend was over and she mentioned that her son has not gone fishing and he would love it.  Of course I offered to bring them and this weekend we will be setting out for an overnight to an upstate river.\n\nThis past Saturday, my girlfriend and I purchased our first vehicle together.  A very nice vehicle.  The only reason we could afford said vehicle is due to the fact that my girlfriends parents offered to pay a large chunk of it, having recently sold their company (we're talking 8 figures).  We are both very proud of this new vehicle in all of its shiny, clean glory.\n\nToday while sitting on the couch talking about our new baby (the car), we had a sudden realization that our friends 5 year old son will be riding in the car with us for upwards of 2 to 2 1/2 hours this weekend.  So I guess my question is, how can keep our new car like new?  My suggestion was to say no food or drinks in the car except water, but my girlfriend is convinced that won't fly with a 5 year old.  Is there any way to \"kid proof\" the car?  Is there any way to do that without offending our friend?  My second suggestion was to throw a painters tarp over the seats back there.  Again, my girlfriend shot that one down saying it would be mean.  How can we convey to her we want him to not make a mess without sounding like jerks?\n\nThanks, hope to hear back soon! \n\nAssistant: "}
